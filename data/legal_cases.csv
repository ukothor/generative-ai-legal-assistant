CO., Inc., v. CAPITAL TRANSIT CO.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nSuit was brought by the owner of an automobile for damages caused to it by the alleged negligent operation of a street car of the- defendant Transit Company. The case was tried by the court without a jury. Judgment was for defendant upon a finding that the car colliding with plaintiff’s automobile was not negligently operated by defendant’s motorman. Plaintiff has appealed. As the question on this appeal is whether the trial court’s finding “is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it” a statement of the pertinent facts will be necessary.\nOn the morning of September 8, 1942, plaintiff was operating his automobile in an easterly direction on Rhode Island Avenue, N. E. Several blocks west of the underpass beneath the tracks of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, he had passed defendant’s street car and had then preceded it along that portion of the street occupied by the car tracks through and to a point 200 feet beyond the underpass.\nAs he emerged from the underpass, plaintiff observed an automobile on the car tracks approximately 200 feet ahead. This automobile driven by one Albright had come from the opposite direction; had made a left turn to cross the tracks, and had been unable to proceed further because of the line of traffic eastbound between the tracks and the curb. A westbound street car was then approaching that automobile, which clearing the westbound track, and unable to advance further, had come to a stop on the eastbound tracks.\nPlaintiff, who was travelling at a speed of 15 to 20 miles per hour as he came from the underpass and became aware of this situation, began to slow his automobile by applying its brakes, until he reached a point close to the obstructing automobile, where he stopped. The westbound street car passed at approximately that time. A moment later his automobile was struck from the rear by the street car which followed him. He did not know where this car was when he came to a stop.\nThe foregoing facts were undisputed. In all substantial details they were corroborated by disinterested witnesses to the collision.\nThe motorman, operating the street car involved, testified as a witness for defendant. He stated that he saw plaintiff’s automobile before entering the underpass, and “when he was coming out of the underpass he saw the MacDonald automobile with brake lights on and off and that he applied his brakes.” He was 30 to 40 feet behind it when it came to a stop. He threw on the emergency, but realized he could not stop in time to avoid a collision. The speed of his car was about 15 miles per hour, at which he could stop in 50 to 60 feet.\nThis covers the entire testimony of the operator of the street car. He does not state whether or not he observed the conditions before him which required plaintiff to stop. Although he saw plaintiff’s brake lights flashing when he emerged from the underpass, 200 feet from the point where the collision occurred, he offers no explanation of the fact that he was going at a speed of 15 miles per hour, 30 tó 40 feet behind plaintiff when the latter came to a full stop.\nDefendant also produced the operator of its car passing on the westbound track. He testified that his car “had passed the Albright automobile just as the MacDonald automobile was coming to a stop.” As the Albright automobile must have cleared the westbound tracks and stopped on the eastbound tracks before this car passed, it is clear that it was not suddenly projected in front of the on-coming automobile and street car, and did not create an emergency which would have made the collision unavoidable.\nA street car company has a preferential but not the exclusive right to use that portion of the streets occupied by its tracks. That area of the street is not withdrawn from the public use. Each must exercise its right with reasonable regard for the other.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for this district has declared that this exercise of reasonable care on the part of the company requires the car operator “to keep a diligent lookout ahead so that the car may be stopped in time, if possible, to avoid injury”; “to have his car under ready control so that it may be readily stopped when the danger is found to be imminent”. It has held that the duty to avoid a collision is not postponed until the car operator has actual knowledge of the peril ahead but arises when by the exercise of reasonable care he would have realized it.\nIn our opinion the operator of defendant’s car failed to observe or appreciate the very obvious situation before him and proceeded, closely following plaintiff’s automobile, at a speed and to a point where a collision was inevitable, and this notwithstanding the fact that as he emerged from the underpass he had been warned of danger by the application of plaintiff’s brakes.\nReversed and remanded for new trial.\nPublic Law 512 — 77th Congress, Act April 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 196, § 7.\nCapital Traction Co. v.

CHEATHAM.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nOn June 28, Í939 appellee purchased from appellant certain premises in Takoma Park, Maryland. A written contract of sale of that date provided in part: “that assessments for improvements completed prior to the date hereof, whether assessment thereon has been levied or not, shall be paid by the seller or allowance made therefore at the time of transfer.”\nIt is conceded that prior thereto improvements consisting of water main and sewer, had been completed by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. Under Maryland law the cost of this improvement is imposed upon the property as a benefit charge and constitutes a lien thereon. Baker v. Smith & Gottlieb, Inc., App.D.C., 132 F.2d 18 decided November 30, 1942. It could have been discharged in the present instance (at the time of the transfer) by a payment of $421.44; otherwise it must be paid in annual installments of $17.68 over a period-of fifty years, the increase in amount representing interest cumulated and prorated.\nWhen the transaction of sale was closed and the property transferred to the purchaser the seller did not pay or make allowance for this assessment. Thereafter he disclaimed liability. Appellee then instituted an action, No. 397,249, in the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia, claiming the sum of $421.44 for breach of the contract.\nThat action was tried by the court without a jury. It resulted in a general finding and judgment for the plaintiff on September 19, 1941 for the sum of $17.36.\nAppellee filed a motion for new trial, alleging that the finding was contrary to the evidence, contrary to law, and that improper evidence had been admitted. The motion was denied.\nOn April 30, 1942 appellee, as plaintiff, filed a second suit against appellant in the Small Claims Branch of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia for the sum of $35.72 “for annual sewer and water assessment for the years 1941 and 1942 which the defendant assumed to pay on the property” (describing said premises).\nUpon the hearing of this case the payment by appellee of two installments of the assessment amounting to $17.36 each was admitted. Each party relied upon the stenographic record and the judgment in Case No. 397,249. No additional evidence was offered. Appellee’s position was, and now is, that in the prior suit there had been an adjudication of his right to be reimbursed subsequent annual payments of the assessment. Appellant by his plea to the complaint claimed that the judgment in the former suit constituted an estoppel against a second action for breach of the contract, and on this defense he now relies. Appellant’s plea was denied by the trial court and judgment was entered for the amount claimed. From this judgment we allowed an appeal.\nIn the reporter’s transcript, it appears that defendant in the first action denied liability for any part of the charge for improvements upon various grounds. Also that he claimed that appellee had not been damaged beyond the $17.36 paid by him, as he might “move away tomorrow” or sell the property and not pay the $404.00 then due to redeem the amount (R. 42, 43).\nThe judgment record in Case No. 397,249 does not show the basis for the allowance of the sum of $17.36. The trial judge in the first action advised the judge presiding at the trial of the present case “that the finding in that case was limited to $17.36, only for the reason that the accrued assessments had amounted to that amount and no more, at the time of the findings in that case.”\nWe express no opinion as to the legal effect of this statement as we do not regard it as material to our decision.\nHere, as in Baker v. Smith & Gott-lieb, Inc., supra, appellee treated the disclaimer of liability and the failure to pay as a total breach and sued for the total damage sustained — the cost of removing the lien as of that date. This was held to be a valid cause of action by the U. S. Court of Appeals. In the case before it that court upheld the contention that the entire cost of the improvements was recoverable in a single action for damages for breach of the contract. We regard this decision as conclusive upon us of the fact that as plaintiff in Case No. 397,249 appellee was entitled to recover an amount sufficient to indemnify him for future installments of the assessment. That the trial court in appellee’s first action adopted a different view and misconstrued his measure of damage is immaterial. His remedy was by appeal from that judgment; not in the filing of a second suit.\nIn Walton v. Ruggles, 180 Mass. 24, 61 N.E. 267, the court through Mr. Chief Justice Holmes said: “The defendant’s contract was entire and was broken before the date of the writ. All the damages that the plaintiff ever is to recover he must recover now.”\nThe suit there was for breach of an agreement to pay an installment mortgage note on which plaintiff, vendor of the property, remained liable. The defense was that plaintiff, at the time of suit, had paid but one installment. The court held that the defendant had breached the contract by his failure to pay the one installment when it matured and that: “The fact that the plaintiff’s absolute obligation may not require to be discharged until a future day at most could entitle the defendant only to a discount for prepayment.”\nIn Kimberly Coal Co. v. Douglas, 6 Cir., 1930, 45 F.2d 25, 28, it was held: “that the trial court was of the opinion that recovery could not be had for future injury proximately caused by the breach, is without effect. The judgment on the merits rendered in the former action between the same parties and by reason of the same alleged breach of contract, operates as an estoppel not only as to every element which was in fact made the basis of the claim, but as to every other matter which might with propriety have been litigated and determined in that action.”\nIn McCargo v. Jergens, 206 N.Y. 363, 99 N.E. 838, 839, suit was brought for breach of a five year contract of employment. A deferred item of $2,000.00 was objected to “on the grounds that it was -not pleaded, and that it did not accrue until after the commencement of the action”. Although included in the original judgment it was eliminated by stipulation and the judgment modified accordingly. A second action was filed for its recovery and judgment given for the amount. In reversing this judgment the court said: “An action for wrongful discharge may include every element of damage arising from the discharge. It is an indivisible action, and one recovery is a bar to any further action for damages.”\nIn Overland Washington Motor Co. v. Alexander, 1915, .43 App.D.C. 282, defendant admitted owing one item of the claim. The court entered a judgment under former Rule 73 for that part and issue was joined on defendant’s pleas denying liability as to the part in dispute. On appeal it was held that the judgment was a bar to the further prosecution of the action.\nSee, also, Philadelphia, B. & W. R. Co. v. Karr, 38 App.D.C. 193; Poling v. Washington Loan & Trust Co., 53 App.D.C. 212, 289 F. 610; Olmstead v. Bach and Myers, 78 Md. 132, 27 A. 501, 22 L.R.A. 74, 44 Am. St.Rep. 273.\nThe effect of a judgment as an estoppel is summarized in United States v. Moser, 266 U.S. 236, 45 S.Ct. 66, 67, 69 L.Ed. 262, as follows: “The general principles [of res judicata] are well settled, and need not be discussed. The scope of their application depends upon whether the question arises in a subsequent action between'the same parties upon the same claim or demand or upon a different claim or demand. In the former case a judgment upon the merits constitutes an absolute bar to the subsequent action. In the latter case the inquiry is whether the point or question presented for determination in the subsequent action is the same as that litigated and determined in the original action.”\nThe present case falls within the first described class. The action is between the same parties, on the same cause of action. The prior judgment is conclusive and no inquiry may be made as to the particular point or question involved in the decision of that suit.\nThe judgment is therefore reversed and the case remanded with instructions to the trial court to set aside the former judgment and to enter judgment for the defendant.\nReversed.\nA close analogy exists between the rule followed in the present case and that applied by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 6th Circuit, in Federal Life Insurance Co. v. Rascoe, 12 F.2d 693, 696. There an insurer denied liability on a weekly payment indemnity contract on the ground that insured was not permanently and totally incapacitated. Suit was for a lump sum, including payments matured and future payments computed on mortality tables. In part, the court said: “This is a single contract. The fact that defendant is required to perform in part at stated intervals does not change its unitary character into a multiplicity of contracts, each relating to but one installment. If there has been an actual breach, coupled with repudiation, of this one contract, then, to avoid a multiplicity of suits, public policy requires that plaintiff may maintain but one action for the entire damages occasioned by such breach.”\nCertiorari was denied, 273 U.S. 722, 47 S.Ct. 112, 71 L.Ed. 859. This is apparently the only Federal Court decision on a question on which State Courts are sharply divided.\nSee, also, Roehm v. Horst, 178 U.S. 1, 20 S.Ct. 780, 44 L.Ed. 953; O’Neill v.

HIGDON.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nParties will be designated as in the trial court.\nThe suit was for damages to plaintiff’s automobile resulting from a collision with defendant’s car at the intersection of 26th and I Streets, N.W., on June 15, 1942. Both were private passenger cars. The accident occurred at noon, the day was clear, the street dry. The only other traffic noted was a southbound truck on 26th Street, north of I Street. There were neither traffic signs nor signals at this corner.\nPlaintiff was driving north on 26th Street; defendant east on I Street. Plaintiff testified that he was driving about 25 miles per hour; that as he approached the intersection he took his foot off the accelerator but did not apply his brakes; that at the time of the impact his speed was 25 to 30 miles per hour.\nHe stated that when about to enter the-intersection he looked to the left and to' the right. He could see about two car-lengths to the left, did not see defendant’s, car, and had practically cleared the intersection when his car was struck on the-left rear.\nA passenger in his car, seated on plaintiff’s right, testified that when they were-about to enter the intersection he saw defendant’s car about two and one-half car lengths away, coming faster than plaintiff’s car was moving.\nDefendant testified that he approached the intersection at about 20 miles per hour. There was a southbound truck on 26th Street, north of I Street, whifch stopped and the driver waved him on. He saw plaintiff’s car when it was 20 feet from the intersection, applied his brakes and slid to the center of the intersection, the front of his car striking the left rear of plaintiff’s..\nThere were skid marks of defendant’s car on the pavement, 12 to IS feet long, commencing 3 feet within the intersection.\nThe trial court found that defendant was negligent, denied his defense of plaintiff’s contributory negligence, and entered judgment for plaintiff.\nUnquestionably the facts established defendant’s negligence. He was required on approaching the intersection, to look both to the left and to the right for on-coming traffic — particularly to his right as traffic from that direction had the right of way. He did look to his left, saw a truck stop, and saw the driver wave him on. He did not see plaintiff’s car until it was 20 feet from the intersection — where his own car was at that time he does not state. Until then he did not attempt to apply his brakes or slacken his speed. As he was presumably driving on the south side of I Street, that part which plaintiff’s car would first enter, a collision was then practically inevitable.\nContributory negligence to bar a recovery is a question of f'act, subject, however, to the application of certain definite legal principles depending upon the facts and circumstances of individual cases.\nHere it is claimed that plaintiff was negligent because he failed to see defendant’s approaching car, citing Faucett v. Bergmann, 57 App.D.C. 290, 22 F.2d 718. That was a pedestrian case. Where automobiles approach an intersection at 25 miles per hour — 37 feet per second — other factors enter.\nThere were cars parked on I Street within 10 or 15 feet of the intersection, which would partially obstruct plaintiff’s view of traffic approaching from that direction. He states he could see two car. lengths back of the intersection. He did not see defendant’s car.\nHaving the right of way over traffic approaching from the left in view of the then proximity of his car to the intersection, he proceeded without looking further. This alone would not constitute negligence in law. He could assume that any car then approaching the intersection would comply with the law.\nIt is also claimed-that the speed at which plaintiff entered and crossed the intersection was excessive and constituted contributory negligence.\nWhile we do not find, under the conditions here shown, that plaintiff’s car was in fact proceeding at an excessive speed, we think the question before the trial court was whether its speed, if excessive, was a contributing cause of the collision. One driving at an excessive or prohibited rate of speed is not barred from recovering unless that is shown to have been a contributing factor to the ensuing collision.\nIn Wallace v. Yellow Cab Co., 238 Ill. App. 283, where the facts were nearly identical with this case, the court said: “We think that the court was also justified in finding that the speed at which plaintiff’s car was running was not the proximate cause of the collision, and that it was caused by the negligent failure of defendant’s chauffeur to check the speed of the cab and allow plaintiff’s car to pass in front of it.”\nUnder the other conditions existing here, had the speed of plaintiff’s car been 20 miles per hour, or even less, the court might well have concluded that this would merely have varied the point of impact of the cars.\nWe are mindful that one having the right of way is not absolved of the duty of exercising reasonable care in entering an intersection. That one is entering in the favored direction must, however, be taken into consideration in determining whether he exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\nWe find no error in the action of the trial court.\nAffirmed.\nGibbs v.

The applicable parts of the statute provide:\n“That the following classes of persons shall be deemed vagrants in the District of Columbia:\n* * * * *\n“(3) Any person leading an immoral or profligate life who has no lawful employment and who has no lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source.”\nTrial was without a jury. Summarized, the government’s proof was that appellant was frequently seen in the night time as late as 2:00 a. m. in the company of known prostitutes and was also frequently seen over a period of several months entering certain small hotels with different men, registering, and going with them above the first floor; that on each occasion she remained for a short time and then left the hotel with the man and .separated from him almost immediately. Immediately after being taken into custody she signed a written confession admitting that she had been engaged in prostitution and had no legitimate employment. At the trial she repudiated the confession, and insisted that she was neither a prostitute nor a vagrant and had for three months been employed in a dry cleaning establishment operated by one Paul M. Bonuso at a salary of $20 per week. The entire trial was reported stenographically and a complete transcript is before us. We have given it careful study in connection with the several errors which are assigned. These we consider and decide separately.\n1. Over objection the arresting officer was permitted to testify to the character of certain women with whom appellant had been seen. Wé think the testimony was proper, for the officer merely stated from his own personal knowledge the fact that those women were known prostitutes. Moreover, the same objection was made later in the trial and was withdrawn.\n2. Appellant contends that the confession was inadmissible and cites McNabb v. United States, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. -, decided March 1, 1943, and Anderson v. United States, 63 S.Ct. 599, 87 L.Ed. -, decided March 1, 1943. Unlike the situation in either of those cases the defendant in this case voluntarily gave her statement immediately after her arrest. The defense claimed that the statement was intended for the Health Department only. Two officers testified however that she was told that her statement might go to the Congressional Investigating Committee, the Health Department, the Social Security Board, the Police Department or to the court. We rule that upon that conflicting evidence the trial judge was justified in admitting the confession.\n3. At the conclusion of the government’s case defendant moved for a dismissal. This was clearly waived when defendant offered testimony in her own behalf. Smith v. United States, 61 App.D. C. 344, 62 F.2d 1061.\n4. To support her claim of legitimate employment defendant produced one Paul M. Bonuso. He testified that from the first part of August to the time of her arrest she had been working for him at a salary of $20 per week, from noon to 8:30 p. m. i Appellant charges that it was error to have permitted the prosecution to ask this witness if it were not a fact “that you carry a number of girls on your rolls for the purpose of showing that they work for you when in fact they are nothing more than prostitutes?” Since the answer was in the negative it is doubtful whether any harm was done by the question. Aside from that, however, we rule that the question constituted proper cross-examination.\n5. Next we consider the error charged for failure to dismiss! the case upon the whole evidence. We think the ruling was correct. We think the evidence of defendant’s association with known prostitutes, her frequent visits to hotels with various men, the circumstances of her entering and leaving the hotels and her voluntary confession all substantially support the charge that she was a “person leading an immoral or profligate life who ■has no lawful employment and who has no lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source.” If as defendant contended she had legitimate employment, proof of such fact was peculiarly available to her. Under the statute, Code 1940, § 22 — 3303, the burden was upon the defendant to show that she “has lawful employment or has lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source.” On the evidence before him the trial judge was justified in rejecting defendant’s claim that she was legitimately employed. He was also justified in rejecting the testimony of her alleged employer in view of the record of convictions which the government proved against him; and also in view of the fact that none of his records or books were brought into court.\nUnder the statute the burden was upon the defendant to establish, and not upon the government to disprove, legitimacy of employment. This principle was established by the Supreme Court in Rossi v. United States, 289 U.S. 89, 53 S.Ct. 532, 533, 77 L.Ed. 1051. There the court said:\n“The general principle, and we think the correct one, underlying the foregoing decisions, is that it is not incumbent on the prosecution to adduce positive evidence to support a negative averment the truth of which is fairly indicated by established circumstances and which, if untrue, could be readily disproved by the production of documents or other evidence probably within the defendant’s possession or control.”\n6. Appellant questions the constitutionality of that part of the statute which places upon the defendant the burden, above discussed, of proving lawful employment or lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source. We think this question has been settled by the Supreme Court in Morrison v. California, 291 U.S. 82, 88, 54 S.Ct. 281, 284, 78 L.Ed. 664. In that case, although the Court held certain provisions of the California Alien Land Law unconstitutional, it said:\n“The decisions are manifold that within limits of reason and fairness the burden of proof may be lifted from the state in criminal prosecutions and cast on a defendant. The limits are in substance these, that the^state shall have proved enough to make it just for the defendant to be required to repel what has been proved with excuse or explanation, or at least that upon a balancing of convenience or of the opportunities for knowledge the shifting of the burden will be found to be an aid to the accuser without subjecting the accused to hardship or oppression.”\nThe court further said: “For a transfer of the burden, experience must teach that the evidence held to be inculpatory has at least a sinister significance.”\nAnd again the court said: “'Other instances may have arisen or may develop in the future where the balance of convenience can be redressed without oppression to the defendant through the same procedural expedient.”\nThe court referring to the earlier case of Morrison v. California, 288 U.S. 591, 53 S.Ct. 401, 77 L.Ed. 970, holding that where the state proved defendant occupied land and by reason of his race was ineligible for citizenship under naturalization laws, the burden could be placed on him to show citizenship by reason of his birth, said: “In the vast majority of cases, he could do this without trouble if his claim of citizenship was honest. The people, on the other hand, if forced to disprove his claim, would be relatively helpless.”\nWe think the present statute comes within the “limits of reason and fairness” prescribed by the Supreme Court. If the prosecution proves that one leads an immoral or profligate life, it does not seem unreasonable to place the burden upon defendant to show lawful employment or lawful means of support realized from a lawful occupation or source. As pointed out by the Supreme Court, the defendant if he has lawful means of support or employment can prove it without trouble, whereas it would be almost impossible for the prosecution to prove that one was without lawful means of support. It would seem that the balance of convenience can be redressed in such cases without oppression to the defendant or subjecting him to hardship.\nIn Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Ervin, D.C., 23 F.Supp. 70, 82, in a per curiam decision of a three judge court, the following was said with reference to the Morrison case: “It is apparent from this decision of the Supreme Court that in determining the validity of a presumption created by a legislative body, two questions, are to be considered: (1) Whether the fact presumed may be fairly inferred from the fact proven; (2) whether the presumption created will be of aid to the state 'without subjecting the accused to unreasonable hardship or oppression.”\nWe think there is no question of the constitutionality of our statute if it is construed so that no burden is cast upon a defendant to prove lawful means of support until the prosecution has first proved, or offered evidence tending to prove, the other elements of the offense.\n7. Defendant contends that the nature of the charge entitled her to a jury trial. The punishment provided in prosecutions of this kind is within the limitations prescribed by Code 1940, § 11— 616, which provides: “In all cases where the accused would not by force of the Constitution of the United States be entitled to a trial by jury, the trial shall be by the court without a jury, unless in such of said last-named cases wherein the fine or penalty may be more than $300, or imprisonment as punishment for the offense may be more than ninety days, the accused shall demand a trial by jury, in which case the trial shall be by jury.”\nThis statute was held constitutional in District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 57 S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843. See also Bailey v. United States, 69 App.D.C. 25, 98 F.2d 306.\nOther errors are assigned and as to them we have reviewed the testimony and find nothing of a prejudicial nature and no ruling or rulings which would invalidate the conviction.\nAffirmed.\nSeo Snitzer v. State, 29 Ala.App. 597, 199 So. 745, for construction of a similar statute. That statute is referred to in Rose v.

SOUTHERN HOTEL SUPPLY CO., Inc.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""CAYTON, Associate Judge.\nThis was a suit for damages resulting from an automobile collision. From a finding for defendant, plaintiff appeals.\nPlaintiff was traveling west on Washington Drive, a two-lane, one-way street. She was in the right-hand lane. She was confronted by a stop sign at the intersection of 12th Street. She stopped at the stop sign and a bus drew up on her left, stopped momentarily, and proceeded into 12th Street. She, likewise, proceeded into the intersection, almost simultaneously with the bus. There was testimony that when plaintiff was at the stop sign the defendant’s truck (along with other traffic) was at the center of the next southerly intersection, heading north, but the record does not disclose how far away that was. The truck was traveling about in the center of the lanes for northbound traffic. Plaintiff claims the truck was traveling about 30 miles per hour, while defendant’s testimony was that it was 20 to 25 miles per hour. Sensing the danger, the bus driver stopped when the front of the bus was about six feet east of the center lane of 12th Street. When the truck was about fifteen feet away from the stopped bus, it swung to the left and crossed about one foot over on the wrong side of the street. Plaintiff, in the meantime, had not stopped but proceeded to pass the bus on the right, and so was in the path of the oncoming truck which struck her car at the left front fender and on the left side. Plaintiff claimed to have looked both ways before entering the intersection and that everything was clear. Her testimony does not indicate that she saw the defendant’s truck at any time before the actual collision.\nUpon this showing the trial judge ruled that there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and ordered a finding for defendant. Appellant claims this was error and relies upon Bland v. Hershey, 1931, 60 App.D.C. 226, 50 F.2d 991. In that case the plaintiff was the only witness, and there was a finding for the defendant, based upon a construction of the right of way regulation which was then in force. The finding was reversed. A different regulation governs in this case, namely, Article 6, Section 28b, which reads: “At any point at which an official ‘Stop’ sign has been erected all vehicles shall come to a complete stop and shall yield to other vehicles within the intersection or approaching so closely thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard, but said driver having so yielded may proceed and other vehicles approaching the intersection shall yield to the vehicle so proceeding into or across said intersection.” We do not suggest that this regulation creates an absolute right of way. It, like the regulation involved in Bland v. Hershey, supra, is relative only and must be construed reasonably and applied according to the circumstances of each case. It created certain favored boulevard •streets, and declared that traffic thereon is entitled 'to priority. It did not, however, give defendant’s driver the privilege of driving blindly down 12th Street, nor to brazen his way through traffic simply be•cause he was on a boulevard street.\nBut the duty of care which rested •upon the plaintiff was no small one. To facilitate the flow of traffic and reduce danger, the framers of the regulation prescribed an inferior right of way for the street she was in. There arose a correspondingly greater demand for care on her part. She was required not only to come to a complete stop, but also to “yield to ■other vehicles within the intersection or approaching so closely thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.” There seems to be no question that she did stop. There is serious question, however, as to whether she exercised care from that point on. In our opinion there was ample basis for the holding below that she was guilty of contributory negligence in any one or all of these respects: (1) in failing to keep a proper lookout; (2) in continuing into the boulevard intersection past the stopped bus and in such a manner as to meet, rather than avoid, oncoming traffic from her left; (3) in failing to see the defendant’s truck, which the driver on her left did see and avoid, and which obviously did “constitute an immediate hazard.”\nOther traffic regulations were received in evidence and their effect argued in the trial court as well as here, but they are general in nature and do not change the legal picture nor indicate error on the part of the trial judge in ruling that the plaintiff, by her own negligence, contributed to her damage.\nAffirmed.\nPar. “e”, See. 2, art. II: “A vehicle approaching a street intersection shall slow down and be kept under such control as to avoid colliding with pedestrians or vehicles. Operators of vohicles approaching a street intersection shall give right of way to vehicles approaching from their right; provided, that a vehicle making a right or left hand turn shall give the right of way to through traffic.”\nFaucett v.

YELLOW CAB CO. OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""HOOD, Associate Judge.\nPlaintiff brought an action for damages for alleged illegal conduct of defendants by which he was prevented from operating. a taxicab. Trial by jury was demanded by plaintiff and the case was set for trial on Tuesday, October 27, 1942. On that day parties and their counsel were present in court at 10 a. m. but the case was not reached until about 3 p. m. At that time a “long panel” of jurors was not available but both sides agreed to accept a “short panel” of twelve jurors. Apparently one of the twelve was disqualified or excused, since by agreement the jury sworn to try the case consisted of only eleven members.\nImmediately prior to the jury being sworn counsel for plaintiff stated he had a criminal case set for trial in the District Court on the following day, that it would not take more than one day and Thursday would be “a free day” for him. The court announced that trial would commence and go as far as possible that afternoon, and be resumed again on Thursday. Plaintiff’s counsel stated this was satisfactory to him. Immediately after the jury was sworn the court stated to the jury that if the case was not concluded that afternoon it would be necessary to continue it until 1:30 on Thursday afternoon.\nThe trial commenced and after opening statements by both counsel plaintiff testified on his behalf and was cross-examined. At 5 o’clock the trial was recessed until 1:30 on Thursday afternoon. At this time counsel for plaintiff stated he had made arrangements to leave on Thursday night for the elections in Indiana and if the case was not completed by 5 o’clock Thursday afternoon, he would request that it go over until the following week. After some discussion between counsel and court as to the number of witnesses yet to testify the court stated it thought the case could be finished by 5 o’clock Thursday and counsel for plaintiff assented.\nOn Thursday at 1:30 counsel met with the court in chambers and plaintiff’s counsel advised the court the criminal case in which he was engaged in the District Court had not been completed on Wednesday, as he had anticipated, but was still in progress and would not be completed until late that afternoon, that his train for Indiana left at 6:30 and he would not return to Washington for one week, that he had attempted to get a substitute counsel but had not been able to do so, and that he was requesting the case be continued one week. Counsel for' defendant objected to such a continuance, and the court stated that after so long an adjournment the jury would forget the testimony already given. Counsel for defendants suggested plaintiff should take a nonsuit but plaintiff’s counsel refused to do so. After some discussion the court asked plaintiff’s counsel if he did not think a nonsuit should be taken and again plaintiff’s counsel refused. Finally the court announced that the trial would be resumed on the following morning. Counsel for plaintiff announced that he would not be present, that his arrangement for leaving the city had been made and he was leaving at 6:30; and he returned to the criminal trial then in progress in the District Court. The court excused the jury which had returned at 1:30 and instructed them to return the following morning at 10 o’clock.\nOn Friday morning the trial was resumed. Neither plaintiff nor his counsel was present. After defendants’ witnesses had testified, the court directed a verdict for the individual defendant and submitted the case to the jury as to the corporate defendant. The jury returned a verdict in favor of that defendant. Judgment was duly entered on the verdict.\nPlaintiff has appealed and argues (1) the court was in error in refusing his request for a continuance, and (2) the court abused its discretion in proceeding with the case in the absence of plaintiff.\nFor very practical reasons it is a general rule that postponement or continuance of a trial is within the discretion of the trial court and the action of the court will not be disturbed on appeal except for an abuse of discretion.\nIn passing upon the request for the continuance the trial court had the right to consider the fact that plaintiff voluntarily commenced the trial on the afternoon of October 27, 1942, since he could not have been compelled to accept a “short panel” of jurors, that counsel for plaintiff announced that he would he ready to resume this case on Thursday and that the court, defendants and their counsel and witnesses, as well as the jurors, accomo-dated themselves to recess from Tuesday afternoon until 1:30 on Thursday because of the engagement of plaintiff’s counsel in the District Court. It may be that plaintiff’s counsel could not have anticipated the criminal case would not be completed on Wednesday, but the fact is he made a definite statement that he would be available on Thursday and the plans of all others engaged in the trial were adjusted on the basis of that statement. When counsel and court met on Thursday at 1:30 and plaintiff’s counsel was still engaged in the criminal case the court did not insist that the trial of this case resume at its scheduled time but postponed it until the following day when counsel for the plaintiff would have completed his engagement in the District Court. The only ground for plaintiff’s request for a continuance was his previously made engagement to go to Indiana for the elections. No doubt.this was a matter of importance to counsel, but it may well be assumed that the court, opposing counsel, the defendants, and the jurors likewise had matters of importance to them. Had the case been postponed a week it would have required the jurors being brought back to court after they had completed their usual term of service, because such postponement would have carried over into the following month. It was the duty of the trial court to weigh and consider the plans and convenience of all parties concerned, and not that of plaintiff’s counsel alone. The defendants had the right to urge that the trial be completed promptly. All these things we must assume the trial court considered and we cannot say that its action in ordering the trial to resume on Friday morning was an abuse of discretion. The question before us is not whether the trial court should have granted the continuance, for that is a matter left to the judgment of the trial court and not the appellate court. Our inquiry must be limited to whether the trial court abused the discretion vested in it, and we find no such abuse.\nWe think the rule applicable to the present case was well stated in Sechrist v. Bryant,.52 App.D.C. 286, 286 F. 456, 459, where the court said: “That any litigant should be denied a hearing is most regrettable, inasmuch as the denial may result in serious actual wrong. Nevertheless the rules which determine the right to a continuance are designed to secure the greatest good to the greatest number, in accordance with law, and as such rules cannot be sacrificed to sympathy, without putting a premium on neglect, want of foresight, and inexcusable delays, they must be enforced in the interest of an effective administration of justice.”\nWith respect to the argument that the trial court abused its discretion in proceeding with the trial on Friday morning in the absence of plaintiff, there was no reason for the trial court assuming the plaintiff’s absence was otherwise than voluntary. On the preceding day counsel for plaintiff had emphatically stated that he would not be present, and, when asked by counsel for defendant if he wished his client to make any response when court opened on Friday, counsel for plaintiff replied, “The record shows my response.” The trial court was justified in assuming that plaintiff’s absence on Friday was due to the absence of his counsel. There is nothing in the record to indicate otherwise, nor was any other explanation offered to the trial judge during or after the trial. After this appeal was noted there were filed affidavits of plaintiff, plaintiff’s counsel and a member of the bar who was not counsel in the case. Plaintiff’s affidavit is to the effect that he was not present in court on Friday, when trial resumed, because of illness. Accompanying his affidavit was a physician’s certificate. These affidavits were never presented to the trial court and this court cannot consider them. “We sit to correct errors of the trial court. It cannot be said that the court erred with respect to a matter not brought to its attention, and upon which it neither ruled nor was asked to rule.” Columbia Aid Ass’n, et al. v. Sprague, 50 App.D.C. 307, 271 F. 381, 382.\nAffirmed.\nThe record does not contain the evidence produced at the trial by either plaintiff or defendants and makes no showing of the merit, if any, of plaintiff’s claim. See Ray v. Carr, 71 App.D.C. 37, 107 F.2d 238.\nAvery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 60 S.Ct. 321, 84 L.Ed. 377; Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. L.

Campbell, 4 Cir., 73 F.2d 97, 100.\nThe certificate stated plaintiff was under care of the physician from October 21 to November 1, inclusive, “and was totally incapacitated during the time.” It is difficult to reconcile plaintiff’s total incapacity during such time with the fact he was in court on October 27 and testified on both direct and cross-examination.\nSee, also, Donovan v. Brown et al., 75 U.S.App.D.C. 93, 124 F.2d 295."", 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.'}, {'text': 'CAYTON, Associate Judge\n(dissenting).\nI think a plain injustice has been done in this case and that the judgment should be reversed.\nWith the general statement of the majority that rulings on continuances “will not be disturbed on appeal except for an abuse of discretion” I have no quarrel. But we must look realistically at the practical application of the terms “discretion” and “abuse of discretion”. Judicial discretion comes into play when there is no fixed rule to guide the judge. For where there is a hard and fast rule there would be an end- — ■ or lack of necessity, for — discretion as a rule of judgment. Discretion does not mean the indulgence of a personal or judicial whim. Nor does it mean the imposition of the arbitrary will or merely individual view of a judge.\nWhen being considered in appellate proceedings abuse of discretion by a trial judge does not necessarily imply improper motive, wilful purpose, prejudice, partiality or intentional wrong. Applying that rule to the instant case it is not necessary to find that the judge was stubborn or arbitrary. The chief test is whether the ruling was in furtherance of justice; and if its effect was to defeat justice it may be deemed an abuse of discretion.\nThe rule which applies here is perhaps best stated in Nicholls v. Anders, 13 Cal.App.2d 440, 56 P.2d 1289, 1292, (quoting from Waite v. Southern Pac. Co., 192 Cal. 467, 221 P. 204), as follows: “It is also well established that it is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on the merits wherever possible, so that any doubts zvhich may exist should be resolved in favor of the application, to the end of securing a trial upon the merits(Italics supplied.)\nAlso peculiarly applicable here is the language of the Supreme Court in an early case as follows: “Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. * * * Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge; always for the purpose of giving effect * * * to the will of the law.”\nWith these principles in mind, I think the trial judge should not have forced the case to a conclusion in the absence of appellant and his counsel.\nIt was not of appellant’s making that the trial was not commenced until the late hour of 3 p. m. He need not have commenced it at all because there was not a full panel of jurors present and he could have declined to proceed until a full panel was available. Nevertheless, he co-operated by accepting a “short panel” and proceeding with the case. Before the day’s proceedings were over appellant’s counsel told the judge that he had made his plans to leave the city two days hence (on Thursday evening) and could not change them. (We should take judicial notice of the difficulty in obtaining traveling accommodations and the even greater difficulty of changing them at the last minute.) Counsel also told the judge that he would be required to be in the District Court the following morning. That engagement he was of course powerless to prevent. But for that engagement he could have completed the case on Wednesday. Moreover there is in the record the court’s statement that it could not resume the case on Thursday morning; so that even if appellant’s counsel had been free to finish the case on Thursday morning the court could not have heard it. Finding himself in that troublesome situation, appellant’s counsel made a fruitless effort to obtain a substitute lawyer to complete the case. Even if he had succeeded there would still be the practical and psychological disadvantage to appellant of having a new lawyer take over the case in the middle of the trial.\nIt seems to me that the judge should have considered the practical result of refusing a continuance and should have seen that it would deprive appellant of his day in court and would result in no trial worthy of the name. Furthermore these alternatives were open to the judge:\n1. To continue the case for one week, as requested. This was refused because the judge appeared to have other cases on that day. The only other reason given was the expense of bringing the jury back. This means nothing because it would have cost no more to bring them back on one day than on another. Nor is there anything to the argument that the jury would be inclined to forget what they had heard; even if that were true, the disadvantage would have been to appellant, because it was he who was plaintiff below.\n2. At the time of the conference in chambers the judge could have ordered a mistrial. This would have resulted in discharging the particular jury before which it had been commenced and having the case reset for trial before a new jury at some later date.\n3. The trial judge could at that time have ordered an involuntary nonsuit instead of attempting to coax appellant into taking a voluntary nonsuit. This would have been tantamount to a dismissal without prejudice, with all costs against appellant, but with the important right reserved to him to re-file his case.\n4. On the critical Friday morning when plaintiff’s attorney could not be there and when plaintiff was unable to secure another lawyer and did not appear at the trial (there is at least some evidence that he was ill) it was still not too late for the court to save the situation. It could then have ordered a continuance, or á mistrial, or a nonsuit. Finally, if the court felt ■that plaintiff had abandoned the case, the logical step would have been to order a dismissal for want of prosecution. Such dismissal would have carried costs against the plaintiff, and would have avoided the inherent injustice of the ex parte proceeding which resulted. But the court ignored the comparative benefits of these possible steps and adhered to its determination that the case be tried that day. That is what I think constitutes error, and demands correction here.\nI am not overlooking the desirability of ■obtaining prompt disposition of cases and of protecting litigants and witnesses from unnecessary delays. But even these important considerations must give way when the alternative result is no trial at all. Contests of will power between counsel and court are always unfortunate; the contestants are not evenly matched, and the judge usually prevails.\nThis is not a case of mere refusal to accommodate counsel, or to extend the courtesy of selecting a day convenient to all for completion of a trial. Nor is it a case where a lawyer has merely been forced to trial before he was prepared. It is a case where the judge selected the only day when counsel could not be present as the one day when the trial must be completed.\nI agree that when discretion has been really discreet and has worked no material injury, we are not called upon to referee personal disputes of this kind. The opposite is true in this case.\nGrant v. Michaels, 94 Mont. 452, 23 P.2d 266.\nPettcgrew v. Pettegrew, 128 Neb. 783, 260 N.W. 287.\nHill v. Finnemore, 132 Me. 459, 172 A. 826.\nOsborn v.

The motion was later amended. In the motion and the amendment, neither of which was verified or supported hy affidavit, garnishee claimed that his failure to answer was due to a misunderstanding on his part and to advice of counsel that the writ did not have to be answered. The trial court denied the motion to vacate and the appeal was taken from the order denying the motion. No appeal was taken from the judgment of June 17, 1942, against the garnishee.\nThe effect of this motion under our Rule 27(d) was to postpone the running of the time for appeal until final action on the motion.\nA preliminary question is whether we may entertain the appeal from the order denying the motion. In the absence of objection a duty is nevertheless imposed on the court to notice an excess of jurisdiction and to limit review to appealable orders or judgments.\nIn International Bank v. Securities Corporation, 59 App.D.C. 72, 32 F.2d 968, it was held that “appeal will not lie from an order denying a motion to vacate a judgment”.\nIn that case, as here, the garnishment was served personally. There the garnishee answered, but failed to answer two of the three interrogatories. A default judgment was entered against it. Two weeks later an attachment was issued on this judgment. The garnishee immediately moved to vacate the judgment, supporting its motion by affidavits stating that it was not indebted to the defendant in the case and that its officer who-signed the return had inadvertently failed to answer the first two interrogatories, thinking that his answer to the last question included the two preceding. The motion was filed during the term at which the judgment was entered. From the order denying the motion to vacate, the garnishee-appealed. The decision would seem to be conclusive of the present appeal.\nThis case has been cited ar^d followed in cases in the Seventh and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals. In one of these cases, Smith v. United States ex rel. Gorlo, the court commented on the decision in Stevirmac Oil & Gas Co. v. Dittman, 245 U.S. 210, 38 S.Ct. 116, 62 L.Ed. 248, construing it as applicable only to motions to vacate filed after the term at which the judgment was entered. The same view was expressed by Judge Learned Hand in Board of Supervisors of Rockland County v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 2 Cir., 80 F.2d 248.\nIn Benson v. United States, 9 Cir., 93 F. 2d 749, 751, where the legal situation was. similar to the present case, the court, citing the Stevirmac case, supra, without comment, said:\n“It is conclusively settled that a ruling upon a motion to vacate a judgment, made in the same term and the same cause in which the challenged judgment is entered, is not an appealable order. Connor v. Peugh’s Lessee, 18 How. 394, 395, 15 L.Ed. 432; Phillips v. Negley, 117 U.S. 665, 6 S. Ct. 901, 29 L.Ed. 1013; Hume v. Bowie, 148 U.S. 245, 255, 13 S.Ct. 582, 37 L.Ed. 438; Stevirmac Oil Co. v. Dittman, 245 U.S. 210, 214, 38 S.Ct. 116, 62 L.Ed. 248; Smith v. United States, 7 Cir., 52 F.2d 848, and cases cited; Board of Supervisors v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 2 Cir., 80 F.2d 248, 250; Republic Supply Co. v. Richfield Oil Co., 9 Cir., 74 F.2d 909, 910, and cases cited.\n“Whatever hardship or injustice, if any, there may be in the denial of the motion, we have no power to consider in the attempted appeal from the motion to vacate the judgment.”\nThis decision was cited and followed in the same circuit in Jackson v. Heiser, 111 F.2d 310, and Hicks v. Bekins M. & S. Co., 115 F.2d 406.\nThe ruling that an order denying a motion to vacate a judgment is not appealable has been adhered to in our courts in an extended series of opinions.\nIn Tubman v. Baltimore & O. R. Co., 1902, 20 App.D.C. 541, the court dismissed the appeal from an order denying a motion to vacate a judgment of dismissal for failure to prosecute.\nIn Swenk v. Nicholls, 1912, 39 App.D.C. 350, the court dismissed an appeal from a motion to vacate a judgment by default.\nIn Dante v. Bagby, 1913, 39 App.D.C. 516, the motion was to vacate a judgment entered nunc pro tunc after the death of the original defendant.\nThe court said: “It will be observed that the appeal was taken from the order denying the motion to vacate the judgment. Appeal does not lie from such an order. The motion is addressed to the discretion of the court, and is intended to furnish the court an opportunity to correct its own error.”\nIn Doyle v. District of Columbia, 1916, 45 App.D.C. 90, where a verdict for the defendant had been directed at the trial the court quoted the above statement from Dante v. Bagby, supra, and said: “That an appeal must be taken from the judgment, and not from the order denying the motion to vacate the judgment, is settled practice in this court.”\nThe ruling in International Bank v. Securities Corporation, 1929, supra, has been stated.\nIt is noted that in each of these cases the motion did not attack the validity of the judgment for lack of jurisdiction but sought relief, usually from the movant’s default in appearing or pleading to an action to which he was a party before the court, and always in a case within the court’s jurisdiction.\nIn such cases the motion must be made within the term or other fixed time limited by rule of court; it must be made while the court retains jurisdiction over its judgment; it is addressed to the discretion of the court and is not reviewable except for abuse of discretion.\nBut where the motion asserts the invalidity of the judgment, as where it has been entered without sufficient service to bring a defendant or garnishee into court, the attack on the judgment has been regarded as an independent proceeding. No limitation of time is recognized. The matter is one of legal right, and to be determined by fixed rules of law. No element of discretion is involved.\nIn Consolidated Radio Artists, Inc., v. Washington Section, etc., 1939, 70 App.D.C. 262, 105 F.2d 785; Wise v. Herzog, 1940, 72 App.D.C. 335, 114 F.2d 486; and Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., v. Shannon, U.S.App.D.C., January 25, 1943, 133 F.2d 397, the United States Court of Appeals for this district has entertained appeals from orders entered on motions to vacate judgments, in each case involving solely the validity of the service oh the judgment debtor. The prior decisions of the same court cited here were noted but not overruled. We, therefore, interpret the last mentioned decisions as applicable only to appeals when the jurisdiction of the court to enter the judgment is assailed.\nWe hold that the order in this case was not an appealable judgment or order.\nHowever, we have carefully examined the record in this case and in view of the importance of the questions of practice involved feel that we should state that we find no basis for the claim that the denial of the motion by the trial court was an abuse of discretion.\nThe motion was based on two grounds: (1) A misunderstanding on the part of the garnishee that he was required to answer the garnishment in ten days after service; and (2) advice of counsel that the garnishment did not have to be answered until after the trial of another and independent suit.\nBoth alleged grounds were based on facts not appearing of record, yet neither the motion nor its amendment were verified or accompanied by affidavit. So far as the record discloses no evidence was offered to support these allegations. This alone would have justified the denial of the motion.\nIn Bush v. Bush, 61 App.D.C. 357, 63 F. 2d 134, 135, after stating that an application to vacate a judgment “is addressed to the sound legal discretion of the trial court” and that “the party in default should show good cause before the default should be set aside” the court commented — “The failure to file an affidavit of his client is significant.” There an affidavit of counsel was filed to support the motion.\nThe garnishment on which the judgment was entered was the third of three served on the appellant. The first, served April 30, was answered May 27, seventeen days late. The second, served May 14, was never answered. The answer to the third, due June 16, was not tendered until June 29, when it was filed with the motion to vacate the judgment of June 17. Garnishee attempted to excuse his failure to answer the third garnishment but offered no explanation of his delay in answering the first or of his failure to answer the second.\nIn his motion he asserts that the defendant was not employed by him after the garnishment was served — June 6th. Yet in the sworn answer to interrogatories tendered with the motion he admits that the defendant was employed by him through June 9th.\nOn the face of the writ is an official notice requiring the garnishee to appear and show cause within ten days after service. On the reverse side is a notice, printed above the interrogatories, that they must be answered under oath within ten days after service, and that upon neglect or refusal so to do judgment may be entered for the amount of the plaintiff's claim.\nHere there was no question that garnishee received all three writs. He used the copy of the first in making the return filed May 27, thirteen days after the second writ had been served personally on him by the marshal. The third was served personally. In considering the merits of his application to be relieved of his default his conduct throughout was pertinent and material for the court to consider in determining whether the delay in answering the third writ was due to inadvertence or indifference.\nThe motion to vacate was addressed to the discretion of the trial court. We cannot reverse unless its denial was an abuse of that discretion, which is not shown in the present case.\nDismissed.\nThis rule is as follows: “When a motion has been seasonably filed for a new trial, or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or to vacate or modify the order, finding, or judgment, the times specified in sections (a), (b), and (c) hereof shall not begin to run until disposition of such' motion.”\nMansfield, C. & M.

I cannot agree that the garnishee must forfeit $350 which he has never owed to defendant, to plaintiff or to anyone else. I disagree with the opinion of my colleagues on both points decided and I here set out my views separately on those points.\nI. The Question of Jurisdiction.\nI find nothing in the case which justifies this court in turning advocate and seizing upon a technical point which was not even suggested by counsel, when its effect is to help perpetuate an injustice.\nThe majority opinion holds that the garnishee Ray has no standing here and no right even to be heard, because he appealed from the order overruling his motion to vacate the judgment, instead of appealing from the judgment itself. Thus his hope for justice is impaled on a stake of artificiality which has no rightful place in modern jurisprudence.\nGreat strides have been made in the past few years in the simplification of court procedure. By legislative action, the rule making power, and the power of judicial interpretation, technical distinctions have been abolished, and the administration of justice placed upon a reasonable businesslike basis. This should mean that the day of the “special pleader” is gone, and that justice is not alone for him who manages to fit the right words into the right places. More important, it should mean that the right of appeal must be unfettered by ruse or artifice. This has been emphasized by the fact that Congress so recently restored the right of appeal to Municipal, Police and Juvenile Court litigants after they had been without it for more than twenty years. It was this legislative action, incidentally, which brought this court into being.\nSurely in this emancipated period of judicial reform there is no justification for the kind of judge-made pitfall which the majority opinion creates. For that opinion says in effect that one seeking a review of the refusal of a trial judge to open a judgment and give him a trial on the merits, is lost unless he is careful to point out that he appeals not from the refusal to vacate but from the judgment itself. Is that not a legal anachronism? Does that distinction not belong in the limbo of the forgotten, along with the “common counts"", the ""money counts”, the “negative-pregnant”, the “absque hoc” and the great host of relics of the legalistic past?\nWhat is the practical difference between noting an appeal from a default judgment and noting it from the refusal to vacate the judgment? Are not the motion to vacate and the overruling thereof bound up with the judgment itself? Does noting the appeal from the refusal to vacate give-the garnishee any unfair advantage ? Does any injury result to the plaintiff? Or any unfairness to the trial judge? If a garnishee or defendant appealed from a default judgment without first filing a motion to vacate would he not be summarily reminded that he had failed to exhaust his remedies below? Whatever words were put into the notice of appeal is it not perfectly plain that this garnishee, finding that a judgment had been entered against him for $350 sought to have it vacated, was refused by the trial judge and comes to us seeking a review of that refusal?\nWe must not forget that in the Municipal Court many defendants and almost all garnishees appear without counsel. But if the rule announced by the majority is to be the law, only those with deft and skillful counsel can hope to find their way into this court. That is hardly in keeping with either the letter or the spirit of the Act of April 1, 1942, reorganizing the Municipal Court, creating this court and requiring us to formulate rules “to provide for the efficient administration of justice, and the same shall conform as nearly as may be practicable to the forms, practice, and procedure now obtaining under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure”. Among said rules is the requirement, Rule 8(f), 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c that “all ■pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice”. Looking to this language it seems to me our plain duty to so construe the notice of appeal as to consider the appeal on its merits; and not close the door of this court to this garnishee and all others in the same predicament, not because counsel urges it or because public policy demands it but because the court itself decides to raise the so-called jurisdictional question.\nAll the local cases cited by the majority were decided before the adoption of the new federal rules, with the exception of the following:\nConsolidated Radio Artists, Inc., v. Washington Section, etc., 1939, 70 App.D.C. 262, 105 F.2d 785. In that case as here the appeal was noted from the overruling of a motion to vacate a default judgment. The United States Court of Appeals nevertheless took the case, heard it on the merits, reversed and remanded it with such directions as were calculated to prevent injustice and bring about a hearing on the merits.\nIn Wise v. Herzog, 1940, 72 App.D.C. 335, 114 F.2d 486, the appeal was from a refusal to open a default in a small claims case, based upon registered mail service. Appellant was not entitled to an appeal of right. Nevertheless the court granted the appeal, considered the merits and wrote an exhaustive and enlightening decision charting the course for the Municipal Court in such cases and preventing future misunderstanding or confusion.\nIn Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., v. Shannon, U.S.App.D.C., January 25, 1943, 133 F.2d 397, the same court exercised its power not to deny an appeal but to grant it and to consider the merits. A reversal resulted.\nTrue it is that in the three cases just mentioned the judgments were sought to be vacated on the ground of improper service. But I can see no practical difference between those cases and this, if notices of appeal, like other pleadings, are to be construed in such a way as to do substantial justice rather than impede it.\nII. The Discretion of the Trial Court.\nA garnishee is brought into a law case under circumstances somewhat similar to those which attend an ordinary witness. In reality, however, he becomes a party to the case, since service of the writ confers personal jurisdiction and binds the property or credits of the defendant (if he has any in his possession) in his hands and places them in custodia legis.\nMoreover a garnishee is almost always an innocent, disinterested third person who is made an unwilling party to a controversy, and subjected to annoyance and expense. He has no prospect of personal benefit, but is directly subject to injury and penalty. For that reason an even more liberal rule should be applied in considering applications by garnishees for relief from judgments of recovery than is applied to ordinary defendants.\nI am satisfied the trial court in the exercise of its discretion should have granted the motion to vacate.\nThe “discretion” which the law authorizes is not a mental or personal one, but to be exercised with careful regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law, and directed by reason and the conscience of the judge to a just result. It is subject to review “where the error in its exercise is plainly shown, and works material hardship and injustice”, or where the reviewing court is satisfied that there has been an erroneous conclusion, or against reasonable, probable and actual deductions to be drawn from the facts. That is so because “it is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on the merits whenever possible, so that any doubts which may exist should be resolved in favor of the application, to the end of securing a trial upon the merits”; for the judicial discretion should be exercised “in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice”. These matters should be noted:\n(1)The first garnishment was a nullity. It was issued and served improperly. The garnishee need not have answered it at all. But he did make full answer under oath stating that he not only owed defendant nothing but that defendant was indebted to him in the sum of $175. That answer, repeated in his answer to the third garnishment, stands uncontradicted in the record to this very moment. It is true that he filed his answer after the statutory ten day period; but it was still not too late, for plaintiff had taken no action in the meantime to enforce the default.\n(2) True, he ignored the second garnishment; but so did the plaintiff.\n(3) On the heels of that came the third garnishment, accompanied on the very same day by a queer suit, unauthorized by statute and unknown to our practice, in which plaintiff claimed $79.80 directly of the garnishee for credits allegedly accumulated during the pendency of the second garnishment. That suit has never been tried and is still pending in the trial court.\n(4) The original judgment against defendant Stotler was and still is under the cloud of direct attack by defendant’s motion to vacate which is still pending and undisposed of. There can be no question that the judgment against the garnishee depends upon the validity of the original judgment. Without such a valid original judgment a judgment of recovery may not even be entered. And if that judgment be vacated below, or on appeal here, the judgment of recovery would necessarily fall with it, leaving the garnishee in the curious and unenviable position of having paid $350 for which neither he nor anyone else is liable.\n(5) Within a little over a month garnishee was confronted with three garnishments and one law suit. It is small wonder that in that confused situation he fell into default. In my view this alone entitled him to a holding that his neglect was excusable.\n(6) I think it is plain that to impose a penalty of $350 with accumulated costs against this garnishee would be to inflict a penalty out of all proportion to the nature of his neglect. This is especially true when we remember that the trial judge had a much more humane alternative, namely, to vacate the judgment and impose reasonable terms upon the garnishee.\n(7) It should not be forgotten that plaintiff could have obviated all the confusion which followed by taking some or all of the steps outlined by our court of last resort in a recent case as follows: ■“As we view it, the statute contemplates (1) the garnishee answering written interrogatories, (2) oral examination of the garnishee, supplementing the answers to the interrogatories, (3) traverse by plaintiff of the garnishee’s answer, after the ■oral examination, and (4), the determination of the issue joined by traverse.”\n(8) The majority opinion makes much of the fact that garnishee did not support his motion by affidavits. I suggest, however, that there is no statute or rule of court that requires such affidavits. Furthermore the trial court could have required, on plaintiff’s application or on its own motion, that the garnishee submit evidence either in the form of affidavits or by submitting himself in open court for examination. Nor is it too late for us to remedy that situation even now, as I point out below.\nIII. Our Alternative.\nAs above indicated, I feel that the judgment should be reversed on the merits. If that is not to be done I think the state of the record is such that we should at least do that which was done in \'Consolidated Radio Artists, Inc., v. Washington Section, etc., supra, so that we may be sure that the limit of our power has been exercised to prevent injustice. There, in a highly similar situation the U. S. Court of Appeals said: ""We feel it our duty to remand the case to the trial court with instructions to reform its order so as to show whether the motion was heard entirely on affidavits and, if so, what affidavits were filed; and if it was heard partially on affidavits and partially on oral testimony or documents, how the latter were proved; and what facts were found by the court; with permission to the court, if in its opinion it will tend to clarify the facts and the right of the case, to grant a rehearing and permit the parties on such rehearing to introduce affidavits or oral testimony.” [70 App.D.C. 262, 105 F.2d 788.]\nThese are my views of the considerations which must be weighed and the disposition which should be made in situations of this kind. If I am wrong, there is little hope for defendants or garnishees who are unwary enough to find themselves in default, and not adroit enough to conform to every technical rule \'thrown in their path.\nThe former method was by application to the United States Court of Appeals. 41 Stat. 1312, ch. 125, § 12.

THALL.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'CAYTON, Associate Judge.\nThe suit was for $676.96 representing the value of certain furniture and other personal property allegedly withheld by defendant, the former husband of plaintiff. Trial was by the court and resulted in judgment for plaintiff.\nPlaintiff testified she and defendant had been married in this District on August 4, 1941, that they separated two months thereafter and that in March, 1942 she obtained an annulment of the marriage in the state of New York. It was her claim that the property involved in this suit had been a personal gift to her from her mother. Defendant contended that the property had been given to him. Cross-examination of the plaintiff developed that she had been working in the District for more than a year preceding the marriage and that her home had been in New York City for more than six years. Pursuing the cross-examination, defendant’s counsel attempted to question her with reference to an affidavit she executed in order to file the annulment suit in Monticello, New York, and attempted to show that Monticello is about 100 miles from her home; he also sought to examine her as to her having sworn falsely in the affidavit filed as a basis for the annulment proceeding, and also to statements made to the court at the hearing of the annulment proceeding. The trial court ruled that all such cross-examination was improper, “that it was a collateral matter and not admissible in this suit”. On this single ground we are required to reverse. This we do on the authority of Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 51 S.Ct. 218, 219, 75 L. Ed. 624. In that case the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 41 F.2d 157, which had affirmed a judgment of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of California. The reversal was based entirely on the refusal to require an answer to a single question which had been put to a witness: “Where do you live?”\nIt happened that the question was not responsive to anything developed in the direct examination; but the Supreme Court pointed out that cross-examination of a witness is a matter of right “and that facts may be brought out tending to discredit the witness by showing that his testimony in chief was untrue or biased”. Speaking for the Court, Mr. Justice Stone said: “Counsel often cannot know in advance what pertinent facts may be elicited on cross-examination. For that reason it is necessarily exploratory; and the rule that the examiner must indicate the purpose of his inquiry does not, in general, apply. [Citing cases] It is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even though he is unable to state to the court what facts a reasonable cross-examination might develop. Prejudice ensues from a denial of the opportunity to place the witness in his proper setting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test, without which the jury cannot fairly appraise them. [Citing cases] To say that prejudice can be established only by showing that the cross-examination, if pursued, would necessarily have brought out facts tending to discredit the testimony in chief, is to deny a substantial right and withdraw one of the safeguards essential to a fair trial. [Citing cases.]”\nIn the case cited the cross-examination of a mere witness was involved. Here it was directed to the plaintiff herself. Her testimony was directly contrary to that of defendant and the case turned upon an issue of fact. That issue was directly connected with the marriage and the marital status. Also involved was the annulment suit which the plaintiff had brought in New York, seemingly in a city and county other than her own home. It was to the circumstances of the filing and prosecution of that suit that the cross-examination was directed. Whether plaintiff could have explained it satisfactorily and what effect the explanation would have had on the final result we have no way of knowing. Such cross-examination was necessarily exploratory and the examiner was not required to reveal the purpose of the inquiry, though in fact he did so. And it is plain that the cross-examination was not “merely to harass, annoy or humiliate” the plaintiff.\nThis is not a case where a series of questions and answers indicated a situation that required the exercise of discretion in limiting further cross-examination. The scope of the inquiry was clear enough, and its propriety equally clear. But, as in the Alford case, “The trial court cut off in limine all inquiry on a subject with respect to which the defense was entitled to a reasonable cross-examination. This was an abuse of discretion and prejudicial error.”\nThe judgment must be reversed with instructions to award a new trial.\nReversed.', 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'CAYTON, Associate Judge.'}, {'text': ""RICHARDSON, Chief Judge\n(dissenting).\nI am not able to accept the construction placed by the majority upon the opinion in Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 51 S.Ct. 218, 220, 75 L.Ed. 624.\n■ The question “Where do you live?” to which the trial court had sustained an objection in that case, it was stated by the Supreme Court, was “an essential step in identifying the witness with his environment, to which cross-examination may always 'be directed” and its purpose was “not, as the trial court seemed to think, to discredit the witness by showing that he was charged with crime, but to show by such facts as proper cross-examination might develop, that his testimony was biased because given under promise or expectation of immunity, or under the coercive effect of his detention by officers of the United States”. Here the object is “to discredit the witness” by showing that she had given false testimony in a collateral proceeding.\nOne may always show bias of a witness by cross-examination as to any collateral fact or circumstance evidencing his state of mind.

UNITED STATES.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nOn November 6, 1942, appellant was arrested on the street in front of her home. The next morning she was tried on in-formations charging solicitation and possession of lottery slips.\nThe officer who made the arrest testified that after a brief colloquy on the sidewalk she had invited him into her house for the purpose of sexual intercourse; that he walked with her to the entrance to the yard in front of her house where he placed her under arrest. He stated that he then hailed a passing police car and carried her to the station. There a book containing lottery or “numbers” slips was taken from her purse.\nAppellant denied the officer’s version of her arrest and specifically denied the alleged solicitation. The trial court found her guilty on both charges, and since the questions involved were wholly factual, and there was substantial evidence on which to base the findings, we have no grounds for reversal.\nNovember 11, 1942, appellant seasonably filed a motion for new trial, accompanied by affidavits of two persons, one known to-appellant at the time to have witnessed her arrest; the other discovered subsequent to the trial.\nThe motion for a new trial was denied' November 18, 1942. Meanwhile, on November 13, 1942, appellant had filed her notice of appeal.\nAt the hearing of the appeal a suggestion was made by counsel that the denial' of the motion for new trial was without consideration of its merits because of the filing of the appeal before the motion was argued and submitted. We therefore directed the trial court to file a supplemental' record showing the grounds for its denial of the motion. This supplemental record was filed and discloses that the court rejected the affidavit of one witness because her presence at the time of the arrest was known to appellant prior to the trial, and decided that the statements in the affidavit of the second witness, if true, were not sufficient to cause a reversal of its finding if a new trial were granted.\nThe granting or denial of a motion for new trial is not ordinarily reviewable on appeal, and this is true of a motion based upon newly discovered evidence unless it is found that the denial was at manifest abuse of discretion.\nHere the trial court had heard the testimony at the trial and was in a position to evaluate, as we cannot, the proposed new evidence. Appellant had during a period of nine years ending in 1940 received six sentences for soliciting prostitution; had paid a total of $175 in fines, and served two ninety day terms. This does not in any degree forfeit her right to-the full and equal protection of the law,. but it does affect the credibility of her testimony. Assuming that the additional witness whose existence was known to appellant could not be produced at the trial, a continuance should have been requested. The trial court properly refused to consider her affidavit in support of the motion for new trial. And we do not find that the ruling of the trial court as to the probative effect of the affidavit of the newly discovered witness was plainly wrong or was an abuse of discretion.\nWhile there is considerable divergence of opinion in defining “abuse of discretion”, courts agree that “difference in judicial opinion” is not synonymous with “abuse of judicial discretion”.\nAs to the conviction on the charge of possessing numbers slips, the affidavits did not attempt to establish innocence but to render inadmissible the evidence on which the conviction was based. The record does not disclose that this evidence was objected to when it was offered; it was not mentioned in the motion for new trial, and apparently this point is raised for the first time on this appeal.\nAlthough we have considered the record to determine whether reversible error exists, it is our opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and not affirmed for the reason that it was taken during the pendency of the motion for new trial, at a time when the judgment lacked “that finality which is essential to appealability.” Leishman v. Associated Wholesale Electric Co., 63 S.Ct. 543, 544, 87 L.Ed. -, decided February 15, 1943.\nThe Act creating this court limited its jurisdiction to appeals from “any final order or judgment”. Our Rule 27(d) provides that when a motion for a new trial has been seasonably filed the time for filing a notice of appeal “shall not begin to run until disposition of such motion”. The adoption of this rule was unnecessary. It was merely a declaration of the general law, serving as a convenient notice to litigants.\nUnder statutes containing similar provisions it has been repeatedly decided bj the Supreme Court of the United States that a judgment is not “final” and is not appealable while a motion for new trial, seasonably filed, remains undecided. This has been the law of this jurisdiction for many years.\nIn the early case of Vincent v. Vincent, 3 Mackey 320, under circumstances similar to the present, the court dismissed the appeal.\nThis case was cited and the rule applied in Southland Industries v. Federal Communications Commission, 69 App.D.C. 82, 99 F.2d 117, where the subject was fully considered and many decisions reviewed. There the court rejected the further contention of the appellant that the appeal might be regarded as dormant and taire, effect upon the final decision of the application for rehearing.\nIn this respect our practice is similar to that of the Federal Courts and those of other jurisdictions where the common law has not been changed by statute.\nThe Act of April 1, 1942, supra, provides that our rules shall conform as nearly as practicable to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. This direction was followed in the adoption of our Rule 17, whereby our jurisdiction attaches upon the filing of the notice of appeal. This cannot result if there is then no appealable judgment or order.\nDismissed.\nSee Thomas v.

I think the appeal should not be dismissed but should be considered on the merits and a reversal ordered.\n1. Notice of appeal was timely, having been filed within five days from the judgment of conviction. Appellant should not he penalized for having filed it before the motion for new trial had been acted upon. Had a new trial been granted appellant could have withdrawn the notice of appeal. Congress re-established the right of appeal in these cases when it created this court a year ago, and we should not destroy that right by technical restrictions.-\n2. The conviction should be reversed because of the refusal to grant a new trial. It seems clear that the officer was seeking to establish a narcotics charge against the defendant. He said he had information that she was a “peddler of narcotics” and the uncontradicted evidence is that while in custody she was examined by a physician to determine whether she was a user of narcotics. The government’s showing on the charge of soliciting prostitution was dubious at best, and rather plainly indicated that the charge of soliciting was placed against the defendant when no evidence for the narcotics charge could be found. The arresting officer himself testified at the very outset of the trial that the defendant told him, “You had better go on down the street because the girls down here all know that you are a policeman” ; that he replied, “Are you kidding ? I’m no policeman”; that defendant then made the unlawful proposal, and that after a brief discussion as to terms, and as they were starting to turn into the yard of her home he placed her under arrest; that a police cruiser containing two other officers “was driving past and witness hailed them and put the defendant into the car and took her to No. 4 police station where he searched her pocket book and found a book of lottery, or number"" slips.”\nDefendant’s testimony was that three officers, Blick, Allen and one “Smiley” drove up as she was waiting for a taxi in front of her home; that one of the officers called her to the car and Officer Allen took hold of her and pushed her into the car; that he took her pocket book and searched it and asked her where the dope was. She testified further that at the precinct one of the officers asked, “What are you going to charge her with ?” and Officer Allen said, “Put soliciting against her, she has a long record, it will stick”. Of this there is no contradiction in the record.\nObviously if defendant’s version of the incident was correct she could not have been charged with soliciting for she had no conversation with the officers but was swiftly pushed into the squad car, searched and arrested. To me it seems significant that neither of the officers in the squad car was called to give testimony. Presumably they could have shed considerable light on what transpired immediately before the arrest and whether Officer Alleni had left the squad car or had had any talk, or time or opportunity to talk, with defendant before the arrest.\nAfter conviction defendant filed a motion for new trial, supported by her own affidavit and those of two witnesses. One was Marie Belt, who made her affidavit while in the hospital, as follows: “I am in the Hospital and that I told the defendant, Georgiana Hamilton, Friday night that I was expecting to go to the Hospital to give birth to a baby; that I had talked with her just before a car drove up and called Georgiana to it; that I saw one of the men snatch her pocket book, look in it, push her in the car, and drive away; that I am a married woman, the mother of four children, with no police record.”\nThe second affidavit was that of Thelma Matthews who swore: “I saw Geor-giana Hamilton when she was called to a car occupied by certain police officers on Friday night, November 6, 1942; that I saw one of them grab her pocket book and push her into the car; that Georgiana did not know that I saw what happened until she was released on bond, Monday, November 9, 1942.”\nIn her own affidavit defendant swore that she had not produced Marie Belt at the trial because she thought she had gone to the hospital to give birth to a baby as she had told her the night before, just before the officers arrested her; that she did not know that the witness Thelma Matthews had seen the incident and did not discover it until after she had been released on bail.\nIt must be remembered that defendant was arrested on Friday evening, tried and convicted the following morning and not released on bail until the following Monday. I am satisfied that the evidence of the two witnesses mentioned was “newly discovered” under the decided cases, and that fairly considered, the testimony, if received, would have been likely to require an acquittal. I cannot agree with the statement in the majority opinion that we are not in a position to “evaluate” the proposed new evidence. This is relinquishing, without reason, one of our plain functions as a reviewing court. The two witnesses were never summoned into court for examination or cross-examination. The trial judge neither saw nor heard them and made his “evaluation” of the proposed testimony solely from the affidavits. Those affidavits are before us and appellant is entitled to have us review them. If at the trial defendant had been corroborated by those two witnesses is it likely that the trial judge would have rejected such persuasive testimony, establishing as it did that there was neither time nor opportunity for solicitation?\nLooking at the picture as presented I am satisfied that the refusal to grant a new trial constituted an abuse of discretion. This term is not so harsh as it may seem. To find abuse of discretion we need not find that there was an improper motive, wilful purpose, prejudice, partiality or intentional wrong on the part of the trial judge. We need only find, as I think we should find here, that the exercise of discretion is subject to review “where the error in its exercise is plainly shown, and works material hardship and injustice.” The judicial discretion should be exercised “in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.” I do not suggest that we should set up our own judgment against that of trial judges in purely discretionary matters, but when the precise ground on which the motion is based is clearly stated and the legal effect of such a ruling is not left in doubt it should be reviewed with the same freedom as rulings upon any other ques- . tion of law. For obvious reasons’ an appellate court should more closely study a ruling refusing a new trial than one granting a new trial. The cases cited dealt with civil disputes and I regard them as applying even more strongly where liberty is involved.\nCertainly neither the nature of the charge nor the prior record of defendant should be permitted to affect her right to a full, fair and impartial trial. When that result has not been achieved, a trial judge should grant a new trial. When it is refused, we should not hesitate to correct the error.\nPettegrew v.

SCHWARTZ.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""HOOD, Associate Judge.\nMrs. Helen Sacchino went to the jewelry store of Charles Schwartz & Son, the ap-pellees herein, and, representing herself to be Mrs. Evelyn Kent, obtained from ap-pellees under a conditional bill of sale a lady’s diamond ring. The sale price of the ring was $400, payable in weekly instal-ments of $5. The conditional sale agreement was executed by Mrs. Sacchino who signed her name as Evelyn Kent. Mrs. Kent is the sister of Mrs. Sacchino.\nSometime thereafter Mrs. Sacchino delivered the ring to her husband in order that he might obtain money on it with which to pay their rent. Mr. Sacchino took the ring to James K. Hughes, an attorney who had represented him in several cases involving charges of false pretenses, and offered it for sale to Mr. Hughes. The latter declined to buy but offered to sell it for Sacchino. The two went to the store of Max Zweig, the appellant herein, operator of a second-hand store and a licensed junk dealer, who had been buying diamonds for many years. Sacchino did not go in the store but waited outside. Hughes went in the store and asked Zweig what he could get for the ring; Zweig examined the ring and offered Hughes $75 for it, which Hughes accepted. Hughes took the money to Sacchino and they together went to a real estate office and paid Sacchino’s rent.\nThe foregoing facts are substantially uncontradicted except those relating to the Zweig transaction. With respect to it, some doubt was raised as to whether the transaction was a pawn or a sale, but Hughes stated definitely it was a sale. Zweig testified that he had known Hughes for a number of years, but denied'buying the ring in question or any other ring from Hughes. The case was tried by the court without a jury and the trial judge found as a fact that the ring in question was delivered by Hughes to Zweig. This finding is supported by substantial evidence and we accept it.\nSchwartz & Son brought the action below for the recovery of the ring or the value thereof from both Hughes and Zweig. A judgment for $314 was rendered against Zweig alone and from that judgment this appeal was taken.\nThe conditional sale agreement was not recorded, and appellant claims the benefit of Title 42, Section 103, District of Columbia Code, 1940 Ed., which provides that such conditional sale shall not be valid “as against third persons acquiring title to said property from said purchaser without notice of the terms of said sale” unless recorded. The trial court ruled that possession only was transferred to Mrs. Sac-chino, that by reason of her fraudulent representations she obtained no better title than a thief, and consequently failure to record the instrument would not have the effect of protecting even an innocent purchaser for value. In this we think the trial court was in error.\nThe fraud of Mrs. Sacchino, in representing herself to be another person, made the transaction voidable but not void. The weight of authority is that where a vendor of personal property intends to sell his goods to the person with whom he deals, title passes even though he is deceived as to the buyer’s identity and responsibility. The cases cited go further than the present case, for in those cases the impostor represented himself to be a person of responsibility, whereas in the instant case, as far as the record discloses, the appellees did not know Mrs. Evelyn Kent and made no inquiry as to her financial responsibility. On the reverse side of the conditional sale agreement was a form of application containing spaces for information regarding the prospective purchaser, but this application was left blank. While no case in this District directly in point has been found, there are cases which we believe recognize the principle first stated. In support of the trial court’s ruling, appellees cite a number of authorities, but those authorities deal with situations where possession alone was delivered and no sale intended. Here ap-pellees plainly intended to make a sale, a conditional one but nevertheless a sale. We think the transaction between the ap-pellees and Mrs. Sacchino was voidable but not void.\nWe agree with the trial court that title did not pass under the conditional sales agreement, but something more than bare possession did pass. The conditional vendee has an interest greater than a mere possession. The exact limits of that interest are not easily defined and have been variously described as “a special property,” or as “an equitable interest,” or as “an equity.” In this District the conditional vendee has been described as “a bailee' for a specific purpose,” and while it is well established in this jurisdiction that a conditional sale is not a mortgage and title does not pass, yet such an agreement is in the nature of a mortgage and the vendor, in substance,, retains nothing more than a lien for hfe security.\nWhile at 'common law a conditional bill of sale was valid not only as between the parties but also as to third parties, our statute requires the recording of such contracts, when the purchase price exceeds $100.00, in order that it be valid as against third persons acquiring title from the conditional vendee without notice of the terms of such contract; and unless the vendor protects his lien by recording, the vendee may convey an indefeasible title to a third party for value and without notice.\nThe appellees did not record the conditional sale agreement and it is evident they had no intention of recording it since it was not acknowledged by the vendee. They did not avail themselves of the benefit of the recording statute and must suffer the consequences if appellant was a purchaser for value and acquired title without notice of the conditional sale. Had ap-pellees recorded the instrument, they would have obtained full protection under the statute even though such instrument was executed in a fictitious name.\nUndoubtedly Zweig gave value for the ring and no contention is made that he had any actual notice of the existence of the conditional sale agreement.\n. The trial judge, while not basing his decision squarely on this point, did hold that the circumstances of the sale to Zweig were sufficient to put him upon inquiry. Those circumstances were that Hughes went to Zweig, whom he had known for several years, and asked Zweig how much money he could get for the ring, that Zweig made no inquiry as to whom the ring belonged but examined it briefly and offered $75 which Hughes accepted. According to appellees’ testimony, this ring was of a value of $400, and while Zweig denied ever having seen the ring, upon a description of it being given to him, stated in his opinion it would have a value of $200. Can it be said, as a matter of law, under these circumstances, that Zweig had notice of, or should have been put upon inquiry as to, the conditional sale agreement? Zweig was a second-hand dealer and it is common knowledge that those engaged in that trade do not pay full value for articles nor do prospective sellers expect full value. Zweig, of course, expected to resell at a profit and he naturally began negotiations by making his lowest offer. This offer was promptly accepted by Hughes. Perhaps Zweig thought he was getting a bargain, but should this make him suspicious? It should be noted that this was not the instance of a total stranger offering a diamond for sale, but the offer was made by a member of the bar whom Zweig had known for several years. There is nothing in the record to indicate any reason why Zweig should suspect that Hughes would offer for sale an article which he did not have the right to sell. Indeed, the trial court found that Hughes’ action was- entirely innocent.\nWhile inadequacy of price may be considered along with other circumstances in determining whether a purchaser had or should have had notice sufficient to put him upon inquiry, inadequacy alone is rarely held sufficient to constitute such notice unless the price paid is merely nominal or absurdly low. Here there' were no other suspicious circumstances. The purchase was made in the usual course of Zweig’s business and from one known to him. The price paid was substantial, even though it did not approximate the amount testified as the market value of the ring. Such testimony, however, as recently said by the Supreme Court, does not reflect true value with nicety and often involves, at best, a guess by informed persons. We do not think the 'price paid uñdér the circumstances of this case wás so inadequate as to constitute notice to Zweig of a possible defect in the title acquired by him.\nFor the reasons stated the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nReversed.\nEdmunds et al. v.

No appeal was taken from that judgment, but on October 12, 1942, defendant below filed a motion to set aside the judgment and grant a new trial. On November 5, 1942 an order was entered denying that motion, and on November 12, 1942 defendant filed notice of appeal from that order.\nAp-pellee (plaintiff below) filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. We heard oral argument on this motion.\nWe have before us the complete record on appeal and are in a position to decide the fundamental question presented by ap-pellee’s motion. The record discloses that the motion to set aside the judgment and grant a new trial is predicated upon alleged errors occurring at the trial of the case, does not involve subsequently occurring or later discovered facts, and makes no charge that the judgment was entered as a result of fraud, accident or mistake. In other words, all matters sought to be raised by the motion could have been reviewed by timely appeal from the original judgment, had one been noted.\nUnder such conditions, an appeal will not lie to review the action of the trial court on such a motion as was filed below. When the right of appeal has been lost, the unsuccessful party cannot reinvest himself with that right by filing a motion of this nature.\nThe prohibition of Rule 27(p) against enlarging the period of time for taking an appeal is absolute.\nThe order denying the motion to vacate judgment and grant a new trial, under the circumstances of this case, was not appeal-able.

CHAS. C. SCHULMAN CO., Inc.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.\nTwo assignments of error in this case require our attention. Appellant assigns as error the action of the trial court in denying appellant’s motion to strike the statement of proceedings and evidence. The facts in this regard, as disclosed by the record and conceded by counsel during the argument, are that after noting an appeal appellant’s counsel prepared and presented to the trial judge on October 3, 1942 a statement of proceedings and evidence and served a copy thereof upon appellee’s attorney; that on October 8, 1942 appellee filed objections to the statement of proceedings and evidence and served a copy upon appellant’s attorney; that thereafter a conference was held by the trial judge with counsel for appellant and appellee for consideration of the statement and objections; that at such conference counsel were not able to agree as to the proper contents of the statement and after a discussion thereof the trial judge directed counsel for appellee to prepare a statement; that counsel for appellee prepared a statement of proceedings and evidence and on October 16, 1942 presented it to the trial judge who forthwith signed it; that no notice of presentation of this statement was given to appellant’s counsel whose first notice was receipt in the next day’s mail of a copy of the statement then already signed by the trial judge.\nThis procedure was, to say the least, irregular. The settling and approval of a statement of proceedings and evidence is a judicial function and an important one, for a properly authenticated statement of proceedings and evidence must be accepted by this court as conclusive. The trial judge should not delegate this duty to counsel for one of the parties.\nIf it was the intention of the trial judge that counsel for appellee should prepare a statement in accordance with instructions of the judge, so that he was imposing upon counsel merely the labor of drafting the statement and not leaving the contents thereof to discretion of counsel, it was still error, under the circumstances, to approve such statement without notice, to appellant. No step in the course of a legal controversy should be taken without notice to opposing party.\nIt was urged at the hearing that appellant was given an opportunity of making his objections to the contents of the statement after it was signed, but plainly he should have been served with a copy and permitted to make his objections pri- or to the signing. Where the statement is prepared by counsel for one of the interested parties, with or without suggestions or instructions from the trial court, counsel for the other side is entitled to be served with a copy and afforded an opportunity of making objections prior to final action thereon.\nThe other assignment of error which we consider relates to the denial of a motion for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. Ordinarily the granting or denial of a motion for a new trial is within the discretion of the trial court and not subject to review on appeal unless there is shown a clear abuse of discretion; and the same rule applies where ‘the motion for a new trial is based upon newly discovered evidence ; but under certain circumstances an appellate court may inquire into the action of the trial court on a motion for new trial. We think the circumstances of this case require our consideration of this assignment. The discretion of the trial court is a judicial discretion, not to be exercised arbitrarily or wil-fully but, instead, in the interest of justice.\nThe action below was brought to recover the purchase price of certain office furniture alleged to have been sold by plaintiff to the defendant. It was admitted that the furniture was delivered by the plaintiff at the defendant’s office and was signed for by defendant, but defendant contended that the furniture was ordered on his own credit by one James Fuller, a sub-tenant of defendant, then trading as Engineers Group, Inc., and Air Defense Club, that defendant signed for the furniture in the absence of Fuller merely as an acknowledgment of delivery of the furniture to Fuller, that he never ordered the furniture, never used the furniture, and his only connection with it was the signing of the delivery receipt. Plaintiff contended that the furniture was ordered by defendant, sold to defendant, delivered to defendant and charged to defendant, and that a bill for it was sent to defendant the day following delivery. The trial court found in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe motion for a new trial, as far as it related to newly discovered evidence, set forth by affidavit that since the hearing of the case it had been discovered that the plaintiff about six weeks prior to the bringing of the instant suit had filed suit against Engineers Group, Inc., for goods, wares and merchandise in the same amount claimed herein, claiming interest from the same date from which interest was claimed in this suit, that defendant believed and expected to prove that the goods, wares and merchandise in that previous suit were the same as in the instant case, and that an affidavit of merit in the previous suit was made by H. A. Herring, the agent for the plaintiff who made the affidavit in the instant case and who was plaintiff’s sole witness. This evidence was vital and material to the issues below for if, as plaintiff contended, it had sold and charged these goods to the defendant an explanation would be required as to why it had previously sued Engineers Group, Inc., for the same goods. Such evidence supported defendant’s claim that he was not a party to the transaction. We think the lower court should have exercised its discretion and granted a new trial upon this showing.\nThe judgment below is reversed with instructions to award a new trial.\nReversed.\nKarrick v.

CO. v. GRANT.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nThis appeal is from a judgment in favor of appellee in a suit brought by her as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. The case was heard by the court without a jury.\nThe opinion of the trial judge contained findings on certain disputed factual issues. However, after hearing argument we were of opinion that the determination of a disputed question of fact not included in these findings of the trial court was material to our consideration of the case.\nThere is no requirement that the trial court file findings of fact. But where, as here, the judgment was entered upon specific findings, leaving undetermined a material issue of fact as to which the evidence is conflicting, we may require a finding on that issue.\nAccordingly we remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to make an additional finding of fact after notice to parties in interest, and to certify the same to this court. This supplemental finding was made and incorporated in the record.\nAppellant was permitted to file a supplemental statement of proceedings and evidence.\nThe material facts are as follows: Plaintiff, Maria Grant, an illiterate colored woman, seventy-five years of age, was the beneficiary named in two industrial insurance policies issued by defendant on the life of her daughter, Elizabeth Grant. The first policy, in the sum of $85, was issued October 9, 1939; the second, for $108, was issued July 2, 1941. The insured died; claims were filed and rejected on the ground that the policies had lapsed for nonpayment of premiums. Separate suits were filed on each policy. The issue in each case was whether the forfeiture of the insurance had been waived by the company.\nBoth policies contained reinstatement clauses which, however, differed in their requirements.\nThe policy issued October 9, 1939, required (1) payment of all premiums in default, (2) payment of four weekly premiums during the ensuing four weeks, and (3) an examination by the company, the latter, however, reserving the right to reinstate without such medical examination.\nThe pertinent provision of the policy issued July 2, 1941, on which the judgment was based, is as follows: “Should this Policy lapse for non-payment of premium, it may be reinstated, if not more than fifty-two premiums are due, by the payment of all arrears and the presentation of evidence of insurability of the Insured satisfactory to the Company and approved at its Home Office.”\nThe insured died May 7, 1942. Death resulted from cancer. Proofs of claim on both policies were rejected by the company upon the ground that the policies had lapsed for nonpayment of premiums on March 30, 1942, and had not been reinstated at the time of death.\nThere was evidence that the company’s collector had failed to call for the weekly premiums as he had theretofore done, but the record does not disclose when or during what period this occurred.\nOn April 26, 1942, the beneficiary, ap-pellee here, sent her daughter (not the insured) to the office of the appellant company to pay the premiums in arrears on both policies. She was told by the ■ company’s representative that the money she brought was insufficient, and an offer of part payment was refused. The following day the full sum in arrears was paid and entered in the premium receipt book. Appellant’s District Office and Home Office are combined at the one address where payment was made. Appellant claimed that the person who received the payment stamped on the premium receipt book, opposite! the entry of this payment, the words “on account of revival as per terms of policy”. Such an endorsement appears in the book. Plaintiff testified that it was not stamped in the book when the payment was made, and was not there until the book was returned after disallowance of the! claim. The trial court found that the endorsement of conditional receipt was not stamped in the book at the time the payment was made.\nWhen she made this payment the beneficiary was not notified that anything further was required to be done by her in addition to payment of the arrears.\nThe president of the company testified that upon the receipt of the premiums on April 27, 1942, he directed the company’s physician to make a medical examination of the insured. This examination had not been made at the time of her death ten days later. The parties interested were not informed that such an examination had been ordered.\nThe proofs of claim show, and it is admitted, that the cancerous condition from which the insured died had continued over a period of eight months and that she had been treated by a physician since January, 1942.\nThe two cases, one on each policy, were consolidated and heard together, resulting in a finding and judgment for the defendant in the suit on the first-mentioned policy; for the plaintiff in the sum of $108 on the second. From the judgment on the second policy this appeal was taken. The evidence relative to the first policy claim is pertinent only to the extent that it explains the dealings between the insured and insurance company bearing upon the question whether the company had waived the provision of the second policy requiring the insured to present evidence of insurability.\nA preliminary question for us to decide is whether the trial court’s findings of fact were plainly wrong or without evidence to support them. We rule that its findings were supported by substantial evidence.\nThe question remaining for determination is whether the trial court was justified in finding that there had been a waiver of the clause of the policy requiring the insured to submit proof of insurability. The issue of waiver in such a case is one of fact, to be tried by jury under proper instructions, or by the court if a jury trial is not demanded.\nIn Hartford Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v. Unsell, 144 U.S. 439, 12 S.Ct. 671, 36 L.Ed. 496; National Ben. Ass’n v. Elzie, 35 App.D.C. 294; Eureka Life Ins. Co. v. Hawkins, 39 App.D.C. 329, and other cases we have examined, this issue was tried by jury. It is significant to note that in the last-cited case the court had directed a ver■dict for the plaintiff. The discussion in the opinion, strongly relied upon by appellant, was necessarily from the point of view that an affirmance of the judgment required that the appellate court find evidence of waiver so conclusive that the trial court was justified in taking the case from the jury. This action of the trial court was affirmed.\nMore than thirty years ago the highest court of this jurisdiction recognized that the interest of the public justified and required the adoption of a liberal policy in favor of the holders of industrial policies of life insurance. In Eureka Life Ins. Co. v. Hawkins, supra, it said: “Courts of justice do not look with favor upon forfeitures which are the result of technical provisions in contracts of insurance. [Cases cited.] Especially is this true where there is involved a so-called industrial insurance policy, like the one here in issue; since policy holders of this kind are frequently illiterate and generally little versed in business matters, hence more likely to be .guided by the conduct and acts of the company than by the technical provisions of the policy. Indeed, it is to be regretted that more adequate protection against the harshness of such contracts is not provided by statute.”\nIn National Ben. Ass’n v. Elzie, supra, the court commented upon the fact, also true in the present case, that the person who received payment was not called as a witness. The court then said: “It had the right to reinstate without examination, in its ■discretion, and must have known that the collector, whoever he was, had waived it by executing the unconditional receipt in the book, instead of issuing the special conditional receipt, according to the ordinary practice.”\nHere the acceptance without reservation of premiums in arrears after refusing a partial payment, the failure of the company to notify the parties interested that this payment was not of itself sufficient, or to return the premiums paid after the -policy had become subject to forfeiture, although the fact of payment was immediately communicated to the president of the company, the illiteracy of appellee, were all matters proper for consideration by the trial court. These facts were, we think, sufficient to support the finding of a waiver.\nThe only action by the company claimed to be inconsistent with a waiver was the direction by the company’s president to its physician to make a medical examination. This was consistent with the reinstatement clause of the first policy, but was not within any provision of the second policy, which is the one involved in this appeal\nAffirmed.', 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.'}], 'attorneys': ['James M.

When delivered to her by defendant, she claimed the contents were mutilated and certain antique articles, a crystal clock, a copper urn and pewter ware, were damaged “beyond replacement or proper repair”. She claimed damages in the sum of $85, plus $40 for incidental personal expense of telephone calls, railroad fare and an effort to employ an attorney in New York.\nThe case was tried by the court and it found that the evidence established liability. No evidence of the value of the damaged articles or of the cost of repair or replacement was submitted. Plaintiff attempted to introduce letters from various business houses containing certain information as to the cost of replacement of a filing cabinet and of the repair of the pewter set, which were not admitted in evidence.\nAt the close of the trial the court continued the hearing to enable plaintiff to produce and exhibit the articles for which damage was claimed in her complaint. After examining these items the court on October 8, 1942, made a finding for the plaintiff in the sum of $15.\nPlaintiff seasonably filed a motion for new trial, alleging that the amount was inadequate, and that the finding was contrary to law and to the weight of the evidence. This motion was denied and judgment entered on the finding.\nThereafter, within the time for noting an appeal, plaintiff filed a motion for rehearing of the motion for new trial. In the alternative plaintiff moved for a judgment on the pleadings, evidence, newly discovered evidence and her affidavit setting forth claims for additional damages which she asked be regarded as an amended complaint. The motion was denied and this appeal then taken.\nThe proffer of ex parte letters as evidence of value or cost of repair was properly denied. In the absence of testimony by plaintiff or some person qualified to estimate the value of the damaged articles, from which the court could properly determine the damage sustained, plaintiff’s case was not complete. However, the court, doubtlessly influenced by the fact that plaintiff was without legal counsel, exercised a wise discretion in continuing the case to permit an examination by it of the damaged articles, resulting in the finding of which complaint is now made.\nSince we find no error in the trial and judgment it must be affirmed. This disposes of plaintiff’s motion for a new trial and for a rehearing of that motion.\nPlaintiff’s alternative motion for judgment (which was in substance to rehear the case upon the theories set forth in an extensive accompanying affidavit) was properly denied. While newly discovered evidence was referred to in the motion, no evidence susceptible of that characterization was submitted.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""HOOD, Associate Judge.\nAppellant, after trial before court and jury, was found guilty of violation of Title 40, Section 609(a) of the District of Columbia Code (1940 Ed.), the offense being commonly known as “hit and run.” The evidence presented by the prosecution was substantially as follows:\nAbout midnight of June 11, 1942, a street car stopped near Fourteenth and Decatur Streets, Northwest, and as passengers were alighting an automobile struck and side-swiped the rear of the car and then struck and injured a passenger who was crossing from the car to the curb. The left front fender of the automobile struck the car and the right front fender struck the passenger. The automobile slowed down but did not stop. Several witnesses observed that the automobile was a black Lincoln Zephyr sedan and bore District of Columbia tag No. 85666. None of the witnesses was able to identify the operator but one witness saw that the operator was dressed in a white uniform and another witness that, he was in a white uniform with a “black bandana” around his neck.\nPolice officers were called to the scene of the accident, and, after talking to witnesses, picking up several pieces of glass, and obtaining information regarding registration of the automobile bearing the tag number given them by the witnesses, went with witnesses to an alley in the rear of 1317 Delafield Place, Northwest, about a block and a half from Fourteenth and Decatur Streets. There they saw a black Lincoln Zephyr sedan in a garage opening on the alley. The door of the garage was open. The automobile had been backed into the garage and the front of it protruded from one to two feet out of the garage. This automobile bore District of Columbia tag No. 85666, its left front fender was damaged and had a streak of green paint on it .(the color of the street car was green), the left front headlight was broken, and the dust had been brushed from the right front fender, as if something had passed over it.\nThe appellant did not take the stand nor present any testimony in his behalf, but his counsel stipulated that at the time in question appellant lived at 1317 Delafield Place, Northwest, was in the United States Navy whose regulations then required the wearing of a white uniform with a black tie, and a Lincoln Zephyr automobile bearing license tag No. 85666, according to the records of the Traffic Division of the District of Columbia, was registered in the name of appellant at the address stated.\nAppellant does not question the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict but contends his Constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure were violated, and that he was denied a fair and impartial trial. His contentions are directed to (1) evidence received and later excluded, and (2) evidence received but not excluded.\nThe evidence received and later excluded is in addition to the' evidence here-inbefore recited. One' of the witnesses, an employee of the street car company, was permitted to testify that at the garage he saw an officer compare the glass picked up on the street with the glass remaining in the broken headlight and heard him remark that it fitted, that at the request of the officer the witness felt the motor of the automobile and found it hot, that the officers brought appellant out of the house and talked with him a few minutes but the witness did not recall appellant answering any questions, and that appellant was dressed in a sailor’s white uniform. Another witness, a police officer, was permitted to testify that at the garage he inserted the broken glass picked from the street in the broken headlight and the pieces of glass matched perfectly, that he removed the glass from the headlight, and that he made an examination of the motor of' the automobile and found the motor, the radiator and the exhaust pipe hot. The glass removed from the broken headlight was received in evidence. The same witness was further permitted to testify that he went to the house at 1317 Dela-field Place and was admitted to the house by someone — older people in the house— and they said appellant would be downstairs in a few minutes. Appellant’s counsel had previously objected that the testimony just recited was secured by an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and the court had permitted the evidence to be received, stating it would be in a better position to rule on this question as the case developed. At the point where the police officer testified to going into the house, the court excused the jury and then heard, in the absence of the jury, detailed statements regarding the location of the garage and the position of the automobile with respect to it, as well as the examination made of the automobile.\nAfter hearing this evidence, the court ruled that it would exclude all testimony concerning questions asiked appellant, the appearanpe of appellant, and all testimony having to do with placing of hands upon the automobile, the extraction of glass from the broken headlight and the comparison of glass found in the street with that remaining in the headlight, in other words, all things discovered while in physical contact with the automobile. In his charge to the jury, the court instructed them to disregard all such testimony. Appellant asserts the court was in error in originally admitting this evidence and that the court’s instruction to the jury failed to cure such error, and further that the glass taken from the headlight, although excluded from evidence, remained in full view of the jury during the entire trial. This court recently pointed out, in Penwell v. District of Columbia, D.C.Mun.App., 31 A.2d 891, that the question of whether error in the admission of evidence is cured by subsequent withdrawal and instruction to the jury depends upon the particular facts of each case. In the present case, assuming the evidence received and then excluded was erroneous, we think the error was cured by the court’s action. No motion to suppress the evidence was made in advance of trial and as soon as it developed in the course of the trial that there was a substantial question regarding the competency of this evidence, the court excused the jury and after satisfying itself that the evidence above recited had been erroneously received, ruled that it should be excluded and the witnesses who thereafter testified were not permitted to give testimony regarding these excluded matters. This action of the court, in our opinion, effectively cured any error which had been committed. As pointed out in the Penwell case, courts are slow to reverse where other evidence in the case strongly supports the verdict of the jury. The evidence regarding the heated motor and the finding of the glass was but cumulative proof of the identity of the striking car. There was ample other evidence on this point. Witnesses who saw the accident stated positively the make, type and tag number of the automobile. The evidence obtained at the alley merely corroborated their testimony. Furthermore, the make and type of the car, its tag number, the damaged left fender and left headlight were all plainly observable to those standing in the alley. The evidence obtained by physical contact with the automobile was but cumulative proof and such proof, even if erroneously admitted, is harmless error. Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 624, 47 S.Ct. 531, 71 L.Ed. 793.\nThe testimony regarding the appel- ■ lant himself, in view of the other evidence, was not prejudicial, especially since the court instructed the jury to disregard it. This case is unlike that of Nueslein v. District of Columbia, 73 App.D.C. 85, 115 F.2d 690, relied upon by appellant, for the reason that the officers in the instant case were permitted to enter the house by the owner, and they obtained from appellant no admission, damaging or otherwise. The only witness permitted to testify regarding any conversation between appellant and the officers merely said: “The officers talked to him there, but I don’t recall him answering any questions.” Any error, if error there was, in receiving this testimony, was not so prejudicial as to require a reversal, in view of the court’s subsequent exclusion of it.\nAppellant further contends that all evidence as to what the witnesses observed while standing near the defendant’s automobile in the garage was obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure because, he asserts, the prosecution did not clearly establish that such observations were made by witnesses while standing on public property. We think appellant draws too fine a line. Mrs. Tierney, the owner of the house and garage, testified, out of the presence of the jury, that the garage is situated about four feet back from the alley and the strip between the garage and the alley is her private property, is paved with concrete and is on the same level as the alley. The automobile protruded nearly two feet out of the garage and the witnesses could have and must have observed the automobile before they approached close enough to step over the line dividing the alley from the private property. At least two of the witnesses did not touch the automobile. If the witnesses trespassed upon private property it was on the property of Mrs. Tierney and not of appellant. According to her testimony, appellant was permitted to use a part of the garage but was not given exclusive possession of it. At most, he had nothing more than the right of ingress and egress over this strip between the alley and the garage. Appellant cannot complain of a trespass upon another's property. In the second place, it is extremely doubtful that a strip such as this, to all appearances a part of the alley, is a part of the curtilage and thus within the protection of the Fourth Amendment. The protection of that Amendment does not extend to open land. Finally, the witnesses observed only that which was open and apparent to anyone in the alley. Appellant did not conceal his automobile in the garage but left it extending out of the garage for all the world to see. Its very position attracted attention. A search is not made by merely looking at that which is open to view.\nWe have carefully examined the stenographic report of the testimony and trial proceedings and are satisfied no prejudicial error was committed and accordingly the judgment below is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nGraham v.

These are the facts as they appear from the record and from certain concessions made in open court upon the argu-meat of the case: The Administrator of Price Control had in March, 1942 fixed the maximum price for nylon hose of the quality, gauge and denier here involved at $2.50 per pair. That continued to be the ceiling price for such hose until October 22, 1942. -On October 20, 1942, at 5:04 p. m. the Price Administrator filed with the Division of the Federal Register a new order known as Maximum Price Regulation No. 95, reducing the maximum price on that type of hose to $1.65 effective October 22, 1942. Presumably the new regulation took effect at 12:01 a. m. on October 22, 1942, or for practical purposes, at the beginning of business hours that day. Plaintiff presented herself at the shop of defendant on October 22 at approximately noon. (Defendant insists it was during the forenoon.) She purchased of defendant a pair of nylon hose of the gauge and denier covered by the order of October 20, and paid therefor the sum of $2.50, or 85 cents more than the new ceiling price. She asked for and was given a receipt. On the following day, October 23, 1942 she filed suit in the Small Claims Branch of the Municipal Court, demanding $50 for the alleged violation. Defendant testified that she had no notice whatever of the new and lower ceiling price and in fact did not receive notice of it until three days after the sale and two days after she had been served with process in the case. She also testified that shortly before that time her father had died and that at the very time she was making the sale her husband was in the shop speaking on the telephone to a doctor concerning certain papers in connection with her father’s estate. Her husband corroborated this testimony. After hearing the case in part, the trial judge continued it in order to obtain testimony as to whether the stockings were actually of the grade and quality which fell within the new $1.65 price limit. After the stockings had been examined by an expert of the Office of Price Administration, testimony was offered to the effect that they were in fact of the gauge and denier which had been reduced in\'price to $1.65 by the order of October 20, 1942. The record is silent as to what method if any had been adopted by the Price Administrator for giving notice of price changes put into effect by his orders.\nUpon that showing, the trial judge refused to adopt the plaintiff’s contention that she was entitled to $50 and limited her recovery to the sum of 85 cents, representing the actual and admitted amount of the overcharge.\nA petition for allowance of appeal was filed with us under the provisions of the Municipal Court Act of April 1, 1942. Because of the importance of the questions involved, we allowed an appeal. We also granted the Price Administrator’s application for leave to intervene in accordance with Section 205(d) of the Price Control Act. Plaintiff appeared without counsel and filed no brief. Briefs were filed and oral arguments presented for the Price Administrator and for defendant.\nThe contention of the Price Administrator is that the trial judge committed error in limiting plaintiff’s recovery to the eighty-five cent overcharge because he was without discretion in the matter and was required under the Act to grant judgment for $50. The section (205(e) of the Act upon which he relies is, in its applicable parts, as follows: “If any person selling a commodity violates a regulation, order, or price schedule prescribing a maximum price or maximum prices, the person who buys such commodity for use or consumption other than in the course of trade or business may bring an action either for $50 or for treble the amount by which the consideration exceeded the applicable maximum price, whichever is the greater, plus reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the court * *\nIt will be noted that the section authorizes a person who has been overcharged in violation of a price regulation to “bring an action either for $50 or for treble the amount by which the consideration exceeded the applicable maximum price.” (Italics supplied.) What does this language mean? Did Congress intend that every overcharge, whether intentional or otherwise, must be regarded as a violation ? Can it be said that every shopkeeper who makes an overcharge whether in good faith or bad, with or without knowledge (or even an opportunity for knowledge) of a change in a price regulation, must forfeit $50 (or more when treble the overcharge amounts to more) ? Does it mean that the courts are completely divested of discretion and must automatically grind out judgments for $50 in every such case? We think not. The statute merely provides that the plaintiff “may bring an action”, etc. An “action” is merely a form of suit by which a plaintiff presents to a court for its determination his demand for money. To “bring an action” has a settled, familiar legal, as well as general meaning. It is synonymous with “commencing a suit”. It is the means by which the judicial machinery is set in motion. It is but the commencement of the suit — the first step by which the judicial machinery is set in motion. It is conclusive of nothing. It constitutes notice to the defendant that he has the right and is required to defend himself against the charge. The plaintiff\'s claim as well as the defense are then submitted to a court or jury, the facts are weighed and the law considered and there follows a judicial determination of the rights of the parties, and whether the “action” has been sufficiently proven to entitle plaintiff to judgment.\nThe quoted section of the Act is both remedial and punitive: remedial in that it provides the method for collecting an overcharge, merely by way of compensation; and punitive in that it authorizes a plaintiff to claim an additional sum which would not otherwise be recoverable. It is in essence a statutory sanction written into the Act to encourage consumer-actions. Thus it amounts to a penalty without reference to the actual amount of damage and is not different from a forfeiture in money.\nWe think the punitive feature must be strictly construed and cannot be operative against a defendant unless the statute expressly authorizes it. Nor can the liability be established or extended by implication.\nUnquestionably Congress could have made the $50 recovery mandatory and could have prescribed that a plaintiff in a situation of this kind would be entitled to treble the amount of the overcharge or $50, whichever amount be greater. In other words Congress by appropriate language could have taken the question of the amount of recovery out of the realm of discretion and fixed it arbitrarily as the amount for which judgment would have to be rendered in every case of violation. It is significant that Congress did no such thing in framing this legislation. It is even more significant that Congress had previously prescribed such mandatory recovery in at least one comparable situation, namely, in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. There Congress provided that any employer violating the provisions enacted by underpaying an employee ""shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of [their] unpaid minimum wages, or [their] unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, amd in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages."" (Italics supplied.) Section 16(b).\nThis was a legislative edict prescribing not only how much the plaintiff might claim but precisely what the recovery should be. Congress said that the court was to have only two functions, (1) to determine whether there had been an underpayment and if so how much and (2) to add 100 percent to that amount as the unvarying and un-variable amount of the plaintiff’s judgment. The courts have several times construed such language to be mandatory and not discretionary. In one of the cases the rule was tersely stated as follows: “Right to the liquidated damages arises automatically with a finding of unpaid overtime compensation. Because of the explicit statement by Congress that ‘an additional equal amount (shall be allowed) as liquidated damages/ the courts are given no discretion in deciding whether they should form part of the recovery.” (Italics supplied.) Abroe v. Lindsay, cited in footnote.\nThe language used in the statute under consideration is very different in its practical application. Unlike the Fair Labor Standards Act, this Act in authorizing the filing of consumer-actions merely formulates the manner in which a plaintiff may compute his claim, and the maximum for zvhich he may sue. It stops short of saying that the defendant “shall be liable” for the amount claimed. Viewed in a reasonable light, we think it does not mean, as the Price Administrator contends, that every shopkeeper who makes an overcharge of even a few cents must forfeit $50 to every customer who decides to sue. If that were so a small shopkeeper could unwittingly put himself out of business in a few minutes by making a series of small overcharges, however innocent his intentions.\nWidespread bankruptcies might easily engulf unwary shopkeepers, large and small, if the contention of the Administrator were adopted as law; for he takes the frank position that every overcharge means a violation and that upon every bare showing of an overcharge, without more, a consumer becomes automatically entitled to the maximum. We do not think Congress intended any such sweeping punitive measure, for it would actually serve to defeat one of the very purposes of the Act which is stated in the preamble, “to prevent hardships to persons engaged in business.” Section 1.\nBlack markets should be suppressed and profiteers punished by every lawful means. On the other hand the innocent should not be swept into court with the guilty and denied an opportunity to present a reasonable defense.\nIn the case before us the new price ceiling was “filed” in the Division of the Federal Register on October 20 at 5:04 p. m., an hour when the business day was virtually over. The order being an “administrative regulation of general applicability” was required to be printed in the Federal Register. The statute provides (sec. 307): “No document required * * * to be published in the Federal Register shall be valid as against any person who has not had • actual knowledge thereof , until it is filed with the Division and a copy “made available for public inspection [in the office of the Director of the Division of the Federal Register].” (Italics supplied.)\nIt was not actually published until two days later — the exact date of the alleged violation by defendant. The record is silent as to the hour of publication and, it is admitted that defendant had not seen the regulation at the time the sale was made. How the plaintiff knew of the price reduction order before knowledge had come to the shopkeeper is of course only conjecture.\nWe rule that upon the showing before us it cannot be held that $50 must be the inevitable amount of recovery. We decide that under the Price Control Act such a ruling would not be justified. We feel that such a ruling would leave no defense to retailers, however innocent their conduct. They would not, for example, be permitted to show that they had been entrapped by someone who managed to obtain advance notice of a price reduction. They would not be heard to say that the overcharge had been made innocently or without notice or opportunity of notice of the order. They would not be allowed to explain the difficulty of interpreting such an order or determining whether a particular price schedule applied to a particular article of merchandise. (This particular schedule included twenty-seven retail prices for various nylon stockings.) Indeed they would not even be permitted to prove impossibility of performance. In short the door of justice would be firmly closed against any attempt they might make to present a defense and court judgments would indeed become automatic. Congress has not said that this should be so. We decline to say so by judicial fiat.\nII. Appellee did not challenge the jurisdiction of the trial court below but has raised the question here. She relies on Title 28 U.S.C.A., Judicial Code, c. 2, sec. 41, sub-paragraph 9, which provides that District Courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction “of all suits and proceedings for the enforcement of penalties and forfeitures incurred under any law of the United States”. Section 205(e) of the Act under consideration provides that “any suit or action under this subsection may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction’ . (Italics supplied.) We do not think that jurisdiction of such actions is exclusively in the United States District Courts. We rule that in using the words, “any court of competent jurisdiction” Congress authorized any federal or state court to take the case if its jurisdiction embraces the amount of the claim. This has been held many times.\nThe Small Claims Branch of the Municipal Court was vested with exclusive jurisdiction of all cases where the amount claimed, exclusive of interest, attorney’s fees, protest fees and costs does not exceed $50. It therefore had jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\nAffirmed.\nHOOD, Associate Judge.\nI agree the judgment should be affirmed but believe affirmance should be on the sole ground that the defendant was without notice or reasonable opportunity to acquire notice of the revised price schedule.\nAs stated in the majority opinion, the revised schedule was filed in the late afternoon of October 20th, to become effective October 22nd. It is conceded the defendant had no actual notice of the new schedule and counsel for the Price Administrator at the argument of the case stated there was no procedure for giving actual notice. In his brief, the Price Administrator states a press release announcing the terms of the new regulation was issued for publication on October 21st, but we are not advised as to whether publication occurred on the 21st or 22nd. Publication in the Federal Register did not occur until the 22nd, and I think we can take judicial notice that the average shopkeeper does not see that publication and probably is unaware that such a publication exists.\nWhile the Emergency Price Control Act does not in terms require notice of a proposed change in schedule of prices, I feel it was the intention of Congress that notice or a reasonable opportunity to acquire notice be afforded storekeepers before they become subject to the penalty provisions of the Act. There is firmly embedded in our conception of justice the principle that no one be subjected to penalties or damages unless he knows or should know that his act will subject him to such. The Emergency Price Control Act itself, it seems to me, recognizes this principle, because ■ the very sub-section of the Act under which the proceeding below was brought provided it should not take effect “until after the expiration of six months from the date of the enactment of this Act.” This provision indicates to me that Congress intended to give the people time and opportunity to learn of the provisions of this new legislation before they became subject to its penalty provisions; and I cannot believe that Congress intended that the Price Administrator might make changes overnight and subject one to penalties who had no notice of the change nor a reasonable time in which to acquire such notice. This belief is confirmed by other recent legislation of a somewhat similar nature. The provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, fixing minimum wages and maximum hours and giving an employee the right to recover liquidated damages from an employer violating its provisions, provided that the minimum wage and maximum hours provisions should “take effect upon the expiration of one hundred and twenty days from the date of enactment of this Act.” The District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act, fixing maximum rent ceilings and minimum service standards and permitting a tenant to bring an action against the landlord violating those provisions, made such provisions effective “on and after the thirtieth day following the enactment of this Act.” If Congress deemed it necessary and advisable in the passage of the acts cited to allow a period of time between the dates of the enactment and the effective dates of the provisions of the acts in order that the people have time and opportunity to acquaint themselves with their provisions and thus be enabled to take precautions necessary to prevent their violations and consequent penalties or damages, then it seems to me that Congress must have intended that retailers have a reasonable time to acquaint themselves with the changes in price schedules before they are deemed violators of the changed schedules. The consideration of the acts prior to enactment attracted much public attention and discussion and their passage became known generally almost immediately, but there was not that same public discussion, if indeed any, prior to this particular change of price schedule. As far as we know, there was no occasion for the defendant in this case anticipating this change in price, and I do not feel that she had reasonable time in which to acquire notice of that change.\nThe Price Administrator seems to have recognized the necessity of giving notice of the change in schedule and adopted as a means Section 1401.6 of the revised price schedule in question, requiring that every person selling nylon hosiery to a purchaser other than an ultimate consumer should, at the time of delivery, furnish written notification to such purchaser that the maximum prices at which such hosiery could be sold had been fixed by the Price Regulation No. 95 of October 20, 1942. This was an effective means of notifying the retailers of the change in prices when they thereafter bought hosiery from a wholesaler or a manufacturer, but, of course, it had no effect in the instant case.\nActs of Congress are to be given a sensible construction, and I think the sensible and reasonable construction of the Emergency Price Control Act requires that no one be held in damages for violation of a revised price schedule pursuant\'to the Act unless he has notice or a reasonable opportunity to acquire notice of the changed schedule. Any other construction would mean that Congress intended to treat alike those who have no notice or opportunity to acquire notice, those who have opportunity to acquire notice but neglect to do so, and those with notice who deliberately refuse\'to comply.\nIt has not been argued, and I do not think anyone would seriously contend, that the defendant in this case had reasonable opportunity to acquire notice of the changed schedule at the time she made the sale in question. For this reason, I am of the opinion there was no violation of the Act, and the judgment below was correct and should be affirmed. If I am correct in my views, it is not necessary that this court consider the other features ot the act discussed in the majority opinion.\nChap. 26 — 2d Session, Public Law 421, 77th Congress, 50 U.S.C.A.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.\nThis is an appeal from a conviction of the offense commonly known as disorderly conduct. The statute, in part, makes it unlawful for any person to use profane language or indecent or obscene words, or engage in any disorderly conduct in any street, avenue, or other public place.\nThe evidence was to the effect that the complaining witness and her escort, a member of the armed services, engaged a taxicab operated by the appellant to take them to the Union Station, that at the station the witness’ escort left the cab and she instructed appellant to drive her to her home several miles away in the Northwest section of the District; that on the way appellant made certain suggestions and remarks to the witness of an indecent and obscene nature, and repeated the suggestions both en route and upon reaching their destination. This occurred at about 1:30 o’clock in the morning.\nAppellant admitted he was the driver of the taxicab but denied making the remarks. The trial was without a jury and the court found appellant guilty.\nAppellant’s chief contention is that the taxicab was a private place at the time of the remarks, that an occupied cab at 1:30 A. M. cannot be considered a public place within the meaning of the statute, and, therefore, no offense was committed. Undoubtedly, the statute is directed at conduct in public places. Such statutes commonly prohibit the use in public places of words which are lewd, obscene or profane, and insulting or “fighting” words, which when spoken face to face are likely to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\nHad appellant made the remarks to the complaining witness while she was standing in the street and preparing to enter the cab, there would have been a clear violation of the statute. Does the fact he made the remarks after she was in the cab make a difference? We think not.\nA taxicab is a common carrier and public utility, deriving its income from the use of public streets and avenues, subject to the call of any member of the public, and while often occupied by only one passenger or one group, it is common knowledge that today such vehicles may and frequently do carry a number of wholly unrelated and unacquainted persons. The fact that the complaining witness was the only passenger at the time is no defense. The presence of others than the offender and the person addressed is not necessary to complete the offense.\nWe are satisfied that a public vehicle plying its business on a public street is a public place within the meaning of the statute.\nAppellant also contends that his remarks did not constitute “profane language, indecent and obscene words.” The record shows no use of profanity by appellant, but, without detailing appellant’s remarks, we think there was ample justification for the trial judge finding such remarks indecent and obscene. The words “indecent” and “obscene” are not susceptible of exact definition, and in determining whether the remarks of appellant were within the prohibition of the statute, the trial judge was entitled to consider all the surrounding circumstances, the time of the occurrence and the manner in which it occurred, the repetition of those remarks, as well as the lack of previous acquaintance.\nFinally, appellant complains the information also charged that “he attempted to engage in conversation a certain female who was then and there unknown to him,” and that this charges no violation of the statute. It is not necessary for us to pass upon this question, since the information contains other specifications clearly within the statute.\nAffirmed.\nCode 1940, 22—1107.\nSee Chaplinsky v.

Trial was had before the court without a jury, resulting in a finding and judgment for the defendant.\nThe record on appeal contains two statements of proceedings and evidence, one being entitled “Plaintiff’s Statement of Proceedings and Evidence,” and the other “Defendant’s Statement of Proceedings and Evidence.” The two statements are in conflict as to the proceedings had and evidence received at the trial, yet both were approved by the trial judge. This situation is accounted for by appellant in his brief with the statement that “the trial judge did not sufficiently recall the evidence at that date to pass upon the contentions of opposing counsel, so by agreement of counsel he approved and sent up contentions of both sides which are in conflict.”\nRule 25 of this court requires all statements of proceedings and evidence to be submitted to and approved by the trial court.\nBy Rule 27(g), (i) and (j) appellant'is required to file and submit to the trial judge a statement of proceedings and evidence; appellee is permitted to file objections to that statement; and the trial judge is required to settle and approve the statement.\nA statement of proceedings and evidence properly settled and approved by the trial judge must be accepted by this court as correct (Graziani v. Arundell et al., 55 App.D.C. 21, 299 F. 886; Klingstein v. Thomas Circle Cafe, 68 App.D.C. 5, 92 F.2d 554), and this court can consider only what the record discloses. Davidge v.

Hall, App.D.C., 129 F.2d 57.\nIn the instant case the trial judge did not settle the statement, but instead approved two conflicting statements. We have neither power nor means of determining what actually occurred at the trial; that is to be settled and determined by the trial court.\nArgument at the hearing was limited to the question of our right to hear the appeal in this state of the record. Consideration of the question and examination of the record convinces us it would be both improper and useless to attempt to pass upon the merits without a record which we can accept as conclusive.\nThis case is remanded to the trial court to settle the differences existing as to what occurred at the trial, and to approve and send to this court one correct statement of proceedings and evidence. If it is impossible for the trial judge to settle the statement of proceedings and evidence, he should set aside the judgment and order a new trial (Hume v.

Humphreys, 9 App.D.C. 392), but since this would deprive appel-lee of the benefit of a judgment already obtained, it is hoped that the trial judge will again make an earnest effort to determine what occurred at the trial and to embody such determination in a single ' approved statement.\nRemanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion."", 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.'}], 'attorneys': ['Vivian O.

INS. CO. v. STANTON et al.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'CAYTON, Associate Judge.\nThis is an appeal from the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia, from a judgment entered on the verdict of a jury in favor of the plaintiffs who sued as beneficiaries of a policy of industrial life insurance.\nThe single assignment of error relied upon relates to the refusal of the trial judge to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant upon the whole evidence.\nThe policy was issued on October 3, 1938, and contained a provision that if the insured had within two years before its date been attended by a physician for any serious disease or complaint, it should be voidable and the liability of the company limited to the return of premiums paid.\nThe insured died on April 18, 1940, less than six months before the policy would, by its terms, have become incontestable.\nThe claim of the beneficiaries for the face amount of the policy was rejected by the company on the ground that the deceased had within two years before the date of the policy suffered from a serious disease or complaint, namely, arthritis. The company tendered the return of $49.20, being the total amount of premiums paid in. This was rejected and suit commenced on the policy. At the trial plaintiffs proved the policy and the death of the insured, and rested.\nThe substance of defendant’s testimony was that the insured had for some time suffered from a severe case of arthritis which involved her left shoulder joint, finger joints, and knee joints, with some involvement of her right elbow; and that she had been hospitalized on three different occasions for treatment of the ailment.\nA physician called by the defendant testified, in substance, that a patient with the symptoms and in the physical condition revealed by the history of the insured was in fact suffering from a serious disease; that it would prevent her from pursuing her normal everyday occupation and had, in fact, incapacitated this patient; that the various bone changes were permanent, although she might from time to time regain the use of the affected parts; that the ailment would tend to become progressively worse and she would finally become bedridden. His testimony was further that the patient would be bound to know she had a serious disease because of the excruciating pain she would suffer, the long periods of time spent in the hospital, and the incapacitating effect of the ailment.\nA sister of the insüred, called by defendant, testified that there were many times during the period between July, 1937, and April, 1938, when the deceased could not walk or use her arms, hands, or legs; that the insured told her that she had arthritis but that she did not consider her condition as serious; that later, during the period when the insured lived with her, she could do ordinary household tasks around the house; that they had discussed the situation many times and the insured never regarded her illness as serious; that insured had told her many times that the doctor had told her it was not serious, and that no one had ever died from it, and that it would leave her as quickly as it came upon her, and she felt that was going to happen.\nPlaintiff in rebuttal called the physician who attended the insured during 1937 and part of 1938, and during all of the time she was in the hospital. He testified that in the early summer of 1937 she was almost totally incapacitated by arthritis; that he had treated her with some success; and that he placed her in the hospital not because she was actually in need of hospitalization but because he was treating her with sulfa drugs and wanted to keep her under observation. He testified that the ailment was serious only in the sense that it temporarily restricted the motion of certain parts of the body; that it was an illness that would, and did, leave the patient as quickly as it had come upon her; that her condition would not be permanent, and that any incapacity would be of a temporary nature; that the arthritis from which she was suffering was not dangerous to life and that it would not, and did not, shorten her life; and that the patient had made a “perfectly marvelous” recovery after she left the hospital in April, 1938, and was able to do ordinary household tasks.\nBy way of further rebuttal a daughter of the insured testified that during the time her mother was in the hospital in April, 1938, she heard the doctor tell her mother that the illness would be only of a temporary nature and that it would leave her as quickly as it had come upon her.\nThe insured died at Georgetown Hospital on April 18, 1940, after an operation for fibroma of the cervix. The cause of death was hemorrhage at operation and postoperative shock. It is conceded that the operation and resulting death were in no manner attributable to the prior arthritic condition of the insured.\nUpon this showing the trial judge refused a peremptory instruction for the defendant, and refused to limit plaintiffs’ recovery to a refund of premiums. He submitted the case to the jury upon instructions to which no exception was taken, and concerning which there is no complaint here.\nThe question presented is whether upon the whole evidence there was a case to go to the jury.\nThe policy involved comes within the purview of Title 35, Section 1002, 1940 edition, District of Columbia Code. The effect of that section is to cast the burden of proof upon the insurer and to require that it establish that the ailment was serious and that the insured knew, or had reason to know, the facts on which the defense is based.\nIn our view there was a substantial conflict in the evidence upon both of these points. The two physicians who testified for the respective parties offered sharply contradictory views on the medical aspects of the case. Furthermore, the physician of the insured directly rebutted defendant’s contention that insured had either real or imputed knowledge of the alleged seriousness of her condition. Further substantial contradiction on this point came from the two lay witnesses.\nIt is established in this jurisdiction that in cases of this type, where there is no conflict in the evidence or no contradiction of a showing of the existence of a serious disease, the trial judge must take the case from the jury and rule as a matter of law in favor of the insurer. Pullen v. Sun Life Ins. Co. of America, 1941, 74 App.D.C. 197, 121 F.2d 110. It is, however, equally well established that where plaintiff creates a substantial issue of fact on the question of unsound health, it becomes a question for the jury and not for the court. Healy v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 1911, 37 App.D.C. 240. See, also, Mays v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 1913, 40 App.D.C. 249, 46 L.R.A.,N.S., 1108, in which the Court said, “If there is room for doubt, the jury should determine the question.” This rule was reaffirmed on a second appeal of the same case, in New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Mays, 1915, 43 App.D.C. 84.\nIt should be noted that the three last named cases were decided prior to the enactment of the Code section cited above, and that the legal position of these plaintiffs is by that fact so much the stronger, becausé by legislative fiat the burden of proof is now placed squarely upon the defendant.\nAside from the statute, we regard the case as one which should have been submitted to the jury. As was said by the Supreme Court in Gunning v. Cooley, 1930, 281 U.S. 90, 94, 50 S.Ct. 231, 233, 74 L.Ed. 720: “Issues that depend on the credibility of witnesses, and the effect or weight of evidence, are to be decided by the jury. And in determining a motion of either party for a peremptory instruction, the court assumes that the evidence for the opposing party proves all that it reasonably may be found sufficient to establish, and that from such facts there should be drawn in favor of the latter all the inferences that fairly are deducible from them. [Citations] Where uncertainty as to the existence of negligence arises from a conflict in the testimony or because, the facts being undisputed, fair-minded men will honestly draw different conclusions from them, the question is not one of law but of fact to be settled by the jury. [Citation]”\nThe most recent expression on this subject was in the case of Jacob v. City of New York, 315 U.S. 752, 62 S.Ct. 854, 856, 86 L.Ed. 1166, decided March 30, 1942, where the Supreme Court said: “Without doubt the case is close and a jury might find either way. But that is no reason for a court to usurp the function of the jury.”\nIn appellant’s brief a number of cases are cited from other jurisdictions. They are not decisive of this issue because they either involve situations where there was no conflict in the evidence or no contradiction by medical witnesses of a showing of unsound health; or they are from jurisdictions where the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to affirmatively establish sound health.\nIn our view of the case the action of the trial judge in submitting the disputed issues to the -jury was correct. The judgment should be affirmed.\n.We think it advisable to direct attention to a procedural aspect of this case. Appellant submitted a Statement of Proceedings and Evidence to the trial judge. Appellees filed objections thereto. Both the statement and the objections were approved by the trial judge and separately incorporated into the record. This makes for confusion and requires us to grope through two disconnected parts of the record to piece the evidence together and reconstruct the factual picture. It is not a compliance with our Rules. The proper procedure would be to have the Statement of Proceedings and Evidence reflect in one document a complete and continuous narrative statement of what happened at the trial.\nAffirmed.\n“If payment of such a policy shall be refused because of unsound health at or prior to the date of the policy, the good faith of both applicant and insured shall constitute a material element in determining the validity of the policy; and it shall not be held invalid because of unsound health unless the insurer shall prove that, at or before the date of issue of the policy, the insured or applicant had knowledge of, or reason to know, the facts •on which the defense is based, or shall prove that the insurance was procured by the insured or applicant in bad faith or with intent to defraud the company, any provision, agreement, condition, warranty, or clause contained in said policy * * * to the contrary notwithstanding. * * * ” (Enacted June 4, 1934.)\nRoush v.

BOWES.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""HOOD, Associate Judge.\nPlaintiff below brought action in the Landlord and Tenant Branch for possession of a room in premises 1728 P Street, Northwest, in the District of Columbia, alleging the room was held by defendant as a tenant by sufferance which tenancy had been terminated by a notice to quit.\nPlaintiff leased the entire premises on or about June 26, 1942, for the purpose of making her home there and renting other rooms in the house. When plaintiff took possession of the premises, defendant was then in possession of the room in question, and plaintiff requested defendant to move to another room as plaintiff desired possession of that room for her own personal occupancy. Defendant refused to move, notice to quit was given by plaintiff, and the action below followed.\nAt the trial plaintiff testified she wished this room for her own immediate and personal use and occupancy as a dwelling, that it was best suited to her needs because it was located near the head of the stairway, was the best room in the house from which to operate the premises, and was the most convenient room for answering the door and telephone downstairs, as well as for keeping order on the premises.\nOn cross-examination plaintiff admitted that the rent for the room in question is the “lowest in the house” but' said that was not the reason she desired it for her own occupancy.\nDefendant testified she had occupied the room in question — -a large room on the second floor — for three years, had bought furnishings for the room, had a private telephone installed in it, and it was best suited for her purposes; that the room had the lowest rental in the house, which was one reason she did not wish to move, and further it was objectionable to her to move at this time and she did not wish to move to the third floor.\nTrial was had without a jury and the trial judge made a finding for the defendant on the ground that “I do not think the plaintiff has proved a case under the Rent Control Act.” The District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act, a temporary measure brought about by the national emergency, was enacted “to prevent undue rent increases and any other practices relating to housing accommodations in the District of Columbia which may tend to increase the cost of living or otherwise impede the national-defense program.”\nThe foregoing Act provides for “maximum rent ceilings” and “minimum service standards,” and restricts the right of a landlord to recover possession of his property. The pertinent provision, so far as the instant case is concerned, is in Section 5 of the Act providing:\n“(b) No action or proceeding to recover possession of housing accommodations shall be maintainable by any landlord against any tenant, notwithstanding that the tenant has no lease or that his lease has expired, so long as the tenant continues to pay the rent to which the landlord is entitled, unless—\ni}c í¡; jjs\n“(2) The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the property for his immediate and personal use and occupancy as a dwelling.”\nIt is evident the Act did not intend to prevent an owner from occupying his own premises, provided such occupancy is sought in good faith and not for the purpose of evading or defeating the purposes of the Act. In such circumstances, where an owner has several properties available, the choice of which one he shall occupy is for him.\nWe think the plaintiff below made out a good case within the meaning of the Act. There is no evidence that she was actuated by caprice or malice, but on the contrary, the evidence discloses a reasonable basis for her demand for possession of this particular room. That the room had the “lowest rent” in the house may have added to her desire to have it for her own occupancy, but we do not think the trial court was justified in concluding that this factor was her chief reason.\nBy designation of counsel for appellant there was included in the record a brief in behalf of plaintiff and a letter of defendant in reply thereto, filed with the trial judge while he had the case under advisement. Briefs and documents of that nature are properly no part of the record and their inclusion tends to create confusion as well as add to the labor and cost of preparing the record. Counsel should avoid any such practice.\nReversed with instructions to enter judgment for plaintiff.\nReversed.\nPublic Law 327 — 77th Congress, approved December 2, 1941, amended September 26, 1942, Public Law 715 — 77th Congress, D.C.Code 1940, § 45-1601 et seq., 56 Stat. 759.\nMess v.

I fully agree that in the special circumstances of this case plaintiff ought not to be deprived of possession of the room she seeks. I am satisfied the evidence supports her claim and removes the situation from the class of tenancies “frozen” by the Rent Act. Considerations of morals, safety, fire prevention and the general benefits of direct personal management amply justify the position that the operator of a rooming house should have possession of a room so situated that she can give the entire house her active personal supervision.\nBut that does not justify the flat ruling ¿hat an owner who has several properties available has the choice of which one he shall occupy. If this language were taken at its face value it 'would constitute an invitation to any landlord (of rooming house or other property) who happened to own more than one property, to point his finger at one particular house or room or apartment and say, “I want it” and “the choice is mine” and the courts would have to stand idly by, impotent to protect the hapless tenant; and without inquiring into the special .circumstances, nod in futile acquiescence “that the choice is with the owner”. In my opinion it is not nearly so simple as that. Various considerations must be weighed in claims of this kind: the good faith of the landlord; the location, size and character of the properties available to him; the rental values of the pi'Operties from among which he seeks to make the choice; the furnishings and facilities in each; the length of time occupied and by whom; the accessibility of each property to transportation facilities; the distance from the places of employment of both landlord and tenant; the special circumstances that prompt him to demand possession of the particular property, and any other material information that will throw light upon the justice of the plaintiffs claim. Only in that manner can the courts decide whether the case should be judicially labelled an exception to the strict provisions of the Rent Act by which tenants are assured that they will not be ousted from their homes unless the suing landlord clearly establishes his claim.\nI am, of course, aware that the language of which I complain was used some twenty years ago by Mr. Justice Van Orsdel, speaking for the then three-judge Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, in Mess v. Mosteller, cited in the opinion of the majority. (It is perhaps significant that one of the three judges merely concurred.) But it must be remembered that those words were used in deciding the claim of a landlord who required the property for the occupancy of himself and wife, both of whom were over seventy years of age and who were living in Chevy Chase, Maryland at a remote distance from the car-line and in quarters inadequate to their needs in going back and forth to the city of Washington where the plaintiff conducted his business. The Court itself was moved to point out that “it is difficult to conceive of a stronger case than the one at bar establishing the necessity of possession of property for the owner’s use and occupancy” [54 App. D.C. 77, 294 F. 1008, 1009],\nNor should we overlook that the language was written in connection with the Ball Rent Act more than five years after the Armistice of 1918, at a time when the emergency contemplated by said act had passed and within a few weeks of the time when it was to be invalidated by the Supreme Court on that very ground. Moreover, the act by its own terms was to expire less than a month after the Supreme Court decision, and less than four months after the Mess v. Mosteller opinion was rendered. Therefore, I cannot agree that it is compelling authority here, for the situation today is vastly different. Far from having passed, the emergency is daily becoming more acute. It is increasingly evident that a critical housing situation exists in the District of Columbia and that the war effort is creating still higher demands upon the housing facilities here, and is giving rise to every tragic variety of hardship. It seems to me that there is nothing in our present Emergency Rent Act and certainly nothing in the facts that we judicially know, that justifies us in saying that the choice between two o.r more properties which a landlord owns is with him alone. Naturally, the initial choice is with the landlord, for it is he who initiates the proceedings. But the ultimate choice is with the courts, and to be exercised only after careful scrutiny of all the circumstances, to determine whether the landlord is justified in choosing from among his properties, and demanding that a tenant yield up possession of a particular room or house or other dwelling unit.\nFor these reasons, while I agree with the result announced in the majority opinion, I decline to accept the views expressed on this point as either safe or proper precedents for the future.\nChastleton Corp. v.

HART et al.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nThis appeal is taken from the decision of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia sitting as a three judge court in the hearing of an application for the review of an order of the Administrator of Rent Control for the District of Columbia, a proceeding authorized by the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act of December 2, 1941. That court held that the application for review was premature, dismissed the appeal, and remanded the case to the Administrator for further proceedings.\nThe petition for review was filed by appellant, who is the owner of an apartment building located in the District of Columbia. The respondents are two of the tenants. The building contains six substantially identical housing units.\nIn February, 1942 appellant initiated proceedings before the Administrator under Sections 4(a) and 4(b) of said Act against certain of the tenants in said building, including the respondents. These petitions were consolidated for hearing and referred to an examiner as provided by Section 8 of the Rent Act. The petitions were heard by the examiner. He recommended orders fixing maximum rent ceilings, which were served upon the parties as provided by Paragraph (c) of Section 8. We do not pass upon the question argued on this appeal whether the examiner made findings of fact as that is immaterial to our decision.\nSection 8 provides that any party may within five days after service of the recommended order request its review by the Administrator. If no such request is made within five days the order automatically becomes the order of the Administrator with the reservation that the Administrator may on his own motion review the proceedings at any time within ten days after such service.\nIt is admitted that these respondents did not request a review of the examiner’s order within five days from the service thereof, and that the Administrator did not review the proceedings within ten days as authorized by this section. However, certain other tenants against whom the petitions under Section 4 had been filed, which petitions were heard by the examiner with those filed against the respondents, did within five days request a review by the Administrator of the recommended order as it affected their cases.\nThereupon the Administrator on June 24, 1942 issued an order for the rehearing of all cases, including those affecting the respondents. This is the order sought to be reviewed.\nIt is urged by counsel for the appellees and counsel for the Administrator appearing as amicus curiae that the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia lacked jurisdiction to review this order. In that we concur.\nSection 9(a) of the Rent Control Act provides that: “Within ten days after issuance of an order of the Administrator under section 4 [section 45-1604], any party may file a petition to review such’ action in the municipal court of the District of Columbia * *\nThis section must be read in conjunction with Section 9(c) which provides: “The municipal court of the District of Columbia is hereby granted exclusive jurisdiction to review any order of the Administrator made pursuant to section 4 of this Act [section 45-1604].”\nSection 4 contains five sub-sections lettered (a) through (e), which authorize the Administrator to adjust maximum rent ceilings and minimum service facilities. Each of these sub-sections authorizes a petition by the landlord, or by the tenant, or in sub-section (a) by either, upon specifically stated grounds. This part of each sub-section terminates with a semicolon. Each sub-section then continues with the statement — “whereupon the Administrator may by order adjust” etc. The only orders specifically authorized to be entered by the Administrator in Section 4 are these orders definitely determining and fixing, pursuant to the proceedings therein prescribed, new rent ceilings or adjusted minimum service requirements. Such orders are in their nature final, and under the requirements of Section 8 must be made after hearing testimony by an examiner.\nThe only other orders specifically provided for in the act are those made under Section 3, and procedural orders under Section 7(b) giving authority “to issue such orders as may be deemed necessary or proper to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Act [chapter] or to prevent the circumvention or evasion thereof.”\nThe initial question for our consideration is whether the authorization to the Municipal Court to review orders of the Administrator applies to any order made in the course of proceedings under Section 4, or is limited to the final orders therein particularly specified.\nIf Section 9(a) giving the right to file a petition for review “of an order of the Administrator under [Section 4]” could be considered as applicable to any order issued by the Administrator in the course of a proceeding under Section 4, it is controlled and limited by the specific jurisdictional grant to the Municipal Court contained in Section 9(c). This limits the review to an order of the Administrator “made pursuant to Section 4 of this Act [section 45-1604]”. The expressions “pursuant to” or “in pursuance of” have a restrictive interpretation. They have been regarded as equivalent to “in conformity with” and imply that what is done is in accordance with an instruction or direction.\nW.e interpret the language of Section 9(c) as referable to the orders specifically provided for in Section 4.\nThe reviewability of procedural orders of administrative bodies has frequently been the subject of discussion in recent cases where Congress has authorized various courts to assume revisory power. The subject was discussed at length in Federal Power Commission v. Metropolitan Edison Company, 304 U.S. 375, 58 S.Ct. 963, 967, 82 L.Ed. 1408. Referring to the provision for the review of “any order” of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the court said: “There are many orders of the Commission which are not judicially reviewable under (this) provision.” Again it said: “With respect to other regulatory bodies, it has been held that mere preliminary or procedural orders are not within the statutes providing for review by the Circuit Court of Appeals.”\nIn Mallory Coal Co. v. National Bituminous Coal Commission, 69 App.D.C. 166, 99 F.2d 399, the court construed the following language of Section 6(b) of the Act of April 26, 1937, 50 Stat. 85, 15 U.S.C.A. § 836(b): “Any person aggrieved by an order issued' by the Commission in a proceeding to which said person is a party may obtain a review of such order * * *.”\nIn that case the court declined to entertain the appeal from an order of the Commission after a thorough consideration of the cases holding that the right of appeal is limited to such orders as are final or definitive in character. It cited with approval the statement of the Supreme Court in Federal Power Commission v. Metropolitan Edison Company, supra, that\n“Such a construction, affording opportunity for constant delays in the course of the administrative proceeding for the phr-pose of reviewing mere procedural requirements or interlocutory directions, would do violence to the manifest purpose of the provision. * * *\n“The provision for review thus relates to orders of a definitive character dealing with the merits of a proceeding before the Commission and resulting from a hearing upon evidence and supported by findings appropriate to the case.”\nWe regard the order directing a rehearing in the instant case as not such an order pursuant to Section 4 of the Act as the Municipal Court is authorized to review.\nThe decision of the Municipal Court is therefore affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nAct of December 2, 1941, Public Law 327, Chapter 553, 77th Congress, 1st Session, 55 Stat. 788, D.C.Code 1940, § 45 — 1601 et seq.\nThis order was as follows:\n“After reasonable notice to the parties herein, and upon consideration of the entire record, objections and argument of counsel, and it appearing to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a rehearing is essential to a complete and final determination of the issues herein involved, it is, this 24th day of June, 1942, under authority conferred by Seetion 7(b) and Section 9(a) of the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act,\n“Ordered, that the above entitled cases be set down for a full rehearing on the merits before an Examiner on the 8th day of July, 1942.\n“And it is further ordered, that the Recommended Order entered herein on May 18, 1942, shall remain in full force and effect until further order of the Administrator.”\nBy Act of April 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 190, establishing the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia it succeeded to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia.\nIndependent School-District v.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.\nAppellant, Rufus Penwell, was charged in the Criminal Division of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia with violations of sections 301 (e) and 609 (a), Title 40, of the District of Columbia Code (1940 Ed.), such offenses being commonly known as “driving without a permit” and “leaving after colliding”. Trial was had before the court without a jury and defendant was found guilty of both charges.\nOne Thomas testified that on March 27, 1942 an automobile operated by him was in a collision with another automobile which came to a stop immediately, that a man got out on the right hand side of the other car, came around to him and said that he would have Thomas’ car fixed if it was brought to the garage where he was employed, that this man looked like the defendant, that several people gathered around at the scene of the accident and the automobile which collided with his was driven away, but that he could not identify the person who drove the car away. One Dean testified that he was standing near the scene of the accident and saw the collision, that there were two men in the automobile which collided with Thomas’ car but that he did not observe the driver of that automobile, that after the collision he saw a man talking with Thomas but this man was not the defendant, that after the accident he saw a man whom he identified as the defendant get into the automobile and drive it away. There was evidence that the colliding car, which bore Maryland tags, was registered in the name of and owned by the defendant and that defendant had neither a District of Columbia nor Maryland operator’s permit.\nDefendant admitted he owned an automobile which bore the Maryland tag number identified as being on the colliding car and admitted he had no permit to operate the car, but testified that on the day of the accident the car was in a garage where defendant was employed, denied that he was driving the car at the time of the accident, and testified that at the time of the accident he was at his home in Maryland with his wife, his sister and his brother-in-law. Defendant’s wife and sister corroborated his testimony that he was at home at the time the accident occurred, though defendant’s sister testified the car was in defendant’s yard in Maryland that day rather than in the garage in the District of Columbia where defendant worked, as defendant had testified.\nThe foregoing is substantially all the evidence offered except the following, which is the basis of one assignment of error. The prosecution called as a witness a police officer, who testified that he interviewed the defendant and defendant denied he had been the driver of the car or had been in the car at the time of the accident. Over objection of the defendant the officer was permitted to testify that he had been informed a Mr. and Mrs. Bryan had witnessed the accident, that Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were called to the office of the Accident Investigation Unit and there in the presence of the witness and defendant Mr. and Mrs. Bryan “positively identified” the defendant as the driver of the car. This testimony was admitted by the trial judge on the theory that the statements had been made in the presence of the defendant and having drawn no reply or denial from him were therefore competent as admissions by silence on the part of the defendant. Later during the trial the judge took the position that such evidence was not admissible and refused to permit the defendant to be cross-examined concerning the identification by Mr. and Mrs. Bryan. In rendering his decision the trial judge stated that he was disregarding the testimony objected to and that his finding was based on the other testimony adduced at the trial. Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were not produced as witnesses and the record discloses no explanation for their absence.\nThe record does not disclose the full circumstances of the alleged Bryan identification, and since the trial court concluded that the testimony regarding it was inadmissible and the government does not now contend it was admissible, we assume the accusatory statements were not made under such circumstances as would render them admissible.\nAppellant contends the testimony regarding identification by Mr. and Mrs. Bryan was so prejudicial as to warrant a reversal. The government, conceding the testimony was inadmissible, contends the error in its admission was cured by the trial judge’s recognition of that error and statement that he was disregarding it in arriving at his decision.\nIt is a well recognized rule that many errors occurring during the course of a trial may be cured by proper and timely action of the trial court. These instances, naturally, more often arise in jury cases. The rule was well expressed by Judge Sanborn, speaking for the eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in Maytag v. Cummins, 8 Cir., 260 F. 74, 82, 16 A.L.R. 712, where he said:\n“The general rule is that if evidence has been erroneously admitted during the trial, the error of its admission is cured by its subsequent withdrawal before the close of the trial or by a clear peremptory instruction to the jury to disregard it. [Citations]\n“But there is an exception to this rule. It is that, where the appellate court perceives from an examination of the record that the inadmissible evidence made such a strong impression upon the minds of the jury that its subsequent withdrawal or the instruction to disregard it probably failed to eradicate the injurious effect of it from the minds of the jury, there the defeated party did not have a fair trial of his case, and a new trial should be granted. [Citations].”\nThis well established rule, and its equally well established exception, have been applied by the Supreme Court in criminal and civil cases and in jury and non-jury cases. In this District the rule has been applied in numerous criminal cases.\nThough the rule and its exception are well established, their application to a particular state of facts presents the difficulty. More latitude will be allowed in a civil case than in a criminal case; likewise more latitude will be allowed in a case tried by the court than in one tried by a jury; and courts are slow to reverse where other evidence in the case strongly supports the verdict of the jury or the decision of the court.\nObviously a case ought not to be reversed for errors which were cured at the trial, but always there is the question whether they were actually and effectively cured. Every error in the admission of evidence cannot be cured, for some evidence by its very nature will leave a lasting impression on the mind of juror or judge. Despite a trial judge’s conclusion that his decision is entirely unaffected by evidence improperly admitted, when it is of a highly prejudicial nature he, like a juror, may be influenced by it without being conscious of its influence. Each case presenting this question must be decided on its particular facts.\nHere the wrongfully admitted evidence squarely contradicted defendant’s claim of an alibi, and the competent evidence was far from conclusive. Could the trial judge, though by training and experience qualified to pass upon the admissibility of evidence and to separate the competent from the incompetent, remove from his mind the impression this evidence must have made when he permitted it to be received? Was he unconsciously affected by it in making his decision, though sincerely believing he could completely ignore it? Did the “reverberating clang of those accusatory words” play a part in his finding defendant’s-testimony unworthy of belief? We cannot answer these questions with certainty but have serious doubts about them, and those doubts must be resolved in favor of appellant.\nThe judgments in both cases are reversed with instructions to award new trials.\nReversed.\nSparf v.

LYON.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.\nOn December 11, 1942, D’Elia & Marks Company, Inc., a tailoring concern, brought an action against Dr. James A. Lyon in the sum of $1974 for goods and services. With the complaint was filed an affidavit by an agent of the plaintiff, averring that the defendant was a non-resident of the District of Columbia and was a resident of Rockville, in the State of Maryland; and a writ of attachment before judgment was issued. The attachment was served upon a local bank and funds on deposit there to the credit of the defendant were seized. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion to quash the writ of attachment alleging he was a resident of the District, and later filed an answer denying any indebtedness to the plaintiff. Oral testimony was taken on the issue raised by the motion to quash and after hearing the trial court entered an order granting the motion. This appeal is from the order granting the motion to quash the attachment. It is an appealable order.\nThe evidence at the hearing was to the effect that defendant is a physician, with an established office in the District of Columbia where he has been practicing his profession since 1925; that he is a member of various District of Columbia medical societies, a former director of a District of Columbia hospital, a member of the medical board of another District hospital and a director of a District bank; that in 1926 he acquired a farm of some 150 acres located near Rockville, Maryland, improved by a spacious dwelling house which has been listed as his residence until recent times; that at the Maryland residence defendant had four automobiles, all registered in Maryland; and defendant when required to register under the Selective Service Act registered in Rockville, Maryland.\nOn September 1, 1942, the defendant leased for one year a large and expensive apartment at 2029 Connecticut Avenue in the District of Columbia and with his wife and child moved into that apartment and they have occupied it ever since. When he moved to the apartment he partly furnished it with furniture brought from the Maryland residence and the remaining furniture at the Maryland residence was put in storage; the Maryland residence was boarded up, the telephone suspended subject to restoration, and defendant has not since occupied the residence, even on week ends. He brought one of his automobiles to the District and operated it here under Maryland registration until) the bringing of this action, when he registered it in the District.\nThe defendant testified that he intends to remain in the District of Columbia indefinitely. On cross-examination, he admitted he and his family lived in an apartment in the District of Columbia for the winter of 1940. An agent of the plaintiff testified that it had been making clothes for the defendant for some twelve years, delivering the clothes to the defendant sometimes at his office in the District and at other times at his residence in Maryland.\nThe sole basis for the attachment is the alleged non-residence of defendant. We do not have here the difficult question of domicile, for one’s domicile may be in one State and his .residence in another; and the word non-resident, as used in our statute, must be taken in its ordinary and usual signification. Residence is the test, and the fact that defendant had an established office in the District and presumably was available for personal service is not material. A man’s residence is where he actually dwells, and ordinarily, but not necessarily, is his home, the place where his wife and children reside. This residence must be a fixed and permanent abode or dwelling place for the time being and not a mere “temporary locality of existence.” It does not have to be permanent in the strict sense of the word since permanency of abode cannot be known without the gift of prophecy; but it must be more than a place of mere sojourning or transient visiting. In determining residence, we are to be guided by the ordinary and obvious indicia of such and the question here is defendant’s residence at the time of issuing and serving the writ.\nIt is clear that defendant was actually living in the District at the time of the attachment and had been so living for several months prior to the attachment. His home, for the time being, was the apartment, regardless of the fact he had residential property in Maryland to which he probably intended returning at some indefinite time. Whether he moved to the District because of the servant problem and gas rationing, as plaintiff suggests, and intends to return to Maryland sometime in the future when he can “afford to go back,” as his testimony suggests, it is evident for the time being he has quit his Maryland residence and established a fixed abode in the District.

REALTY ASSOCIATES, Inc.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nSuit was brought by Realty Associates, Inc., a licensed real estate broker, claiming a commission for the sale of a house. The case was tried by the court without a jury, resulting in a judgment for the plaintiff for $462.50, a full commission at the usual rate.\nDefendants have appealed. The only error assigned is the finding of the trial court that plaintiff was the procuring cause of the sale.\nOn January 26, 1942, defendants appointed plaintiff exclusive agent for the sale of their house, No. 3355 Denver Street, N. E. This appointment was limited to March 3, 1942, and contained the fol'owing provision: “The purchaser is to arrange his own financing.”\nPlaintiff advertised the property for sale and on March 2 submitted to defendants a written offer of one Obergh. This contained a condition that plaintiff should obtain an additional loan on property Obergh then owned and occupied and should also procure an increased loan on defendants’ property. It also provided: “Deposit to be refunded if financing is not obtained by Realty Associates, Inc.”\nWhen this proposed contract was submitted to defendants on March 2, it was accepted subj ect to the following: “Acceptance by purchaser and all financing conditions to be decided by March 6, 1942.”\nOn the same day the purchaser endorsed his acceptance on the contract.\nPlaintiff immediately had the purchaser sign applications for the required loans, and on March 6th, commitments for each loan were made by building associations of unquestioned financial ability.\nOn Friday, March 6th, before it was known to- plaintiff or defendants that the financing had then been committed, in an interview between an agent of the plaintiff and the purchaser, the latter demanded the return of his check for the $200 deposit, because, he said, the financing had not been obtained, and he had decided to call the deal off and remain in his own house. Plaintiff’s agent then handed the check to the purchaser.\nPlaintiff immediately notified defendants of this and asked permission to advertise the property over the week-end, which was granted, and the advertisement inserted.\nOn the following morning, Saturday, March 7th, plaintiff requested permission to have its salesman on the premises, but was informed by defendant John E. Lady that the property had been sold. A representative of the plaintiff went to the premises to obtain its sign. In response to his inquiry as to the purchaser he was informed by said defendant that the sale had been made to a person from New York brought to him by a neighbor. This was not the fact. The purchaser was actually Obergh, who had, on the day following the withdrawal of his deposit, entered into a new contract with defendants at a price $450 less than that named in their former contract, on which plaintiff’s commission would have been $485.\nObergh, called by defendants, testified that he had not become interested in the purchase of the house until after he- had seen plaintiff’s advertisement and had been shown through the house by plaintiff’s agent. He admitted that while the sale was pending he had told plaintiff’s representative he did not know defendants’ new address, which was not true. Correspondence between defendant John E. Lady and Obergh during the period required to close the sale reveals an understanding between them that plaintiff was not to be informed of the identity of the purchaser or of the Richmond address to which defendants had moved.\nThe trial court determined that the return of the deposit by Obergh was procured by him with intent to defeat the plaintiff’s right to a commission and to secure the advantage of a reduction in price which might be accomplished by delaying the transaction beyond March 6th.\nThe only issue before us is whether the trial court was right in deciding that plaintiff’s services were the procuring cause of the sale.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for this District has repeatedly held that where a purchaser is interested by a broker in a particular property and thereafter becomes the purchaser by completing negotiations directly with the owner, the broker must be regarded as the procuring cause of the sale. Here, the purchaser testified that he became interested in the purchase of the property by seeing the plaintiff’s advertisement and being shown through the property by plaintiff’s agent. As there was no independent intervening cause the case comes very clearly within the recognized rule.\nNor does the evidence show an abandonment by the agent so as to defeat recovery within the meaning of Bryan v. Abert, 3 App.D.C. 180 or Sechrist v. Atkinson, 31 App.D.C. 1. The return of the deposit to Obergh on March 6th, certainly did not constitute an abandonment under the circumstances recited. There can be no valid abandonment by an act induced entirely by misrepresentation and fraud. The trial court found, and we approve its finding, that the return of the deposit was secured by misrepresentation and with the intent to avoid payment of the commission. Although the defendants may have been innocent of participation therein on March 6th, they undoubtedly realized the true situation when less than twenty-four hours later Obergh came to them to purchase the property. They were certainly put upon notice and the circumstances of concealment and misrepresentation to plaintiff of the identity of the purchaser would indicate that there was actual notice, or at least such constructive notice as the law imposes upon one who is confronted with a situation which would put any reasonable person on inquiry.\nWe, therefore, hold that the judgment of the trial court was correct.\nAffirmed.\nSimms v.

MARLYN APARTMENT CO. COPELIN v. SAME. SAMUEL v. SAME.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""CAYTON, Associate Judge.\nDefendants appeal from a judgment of the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Municipal Court ousting them of possession of three certain apartments in the Marlyn Apartments. The judgment was predicated upon a violation of the following provision in the respective leases: “No animals, birds or pets of any kind shall be kept or harbored in the leased premises, without express consent in writing by the Lessor, and such consent, if given, shall be revocable by the Lessor at any time. * * *” The landlord had granted informal oral permission to keep dogs. Such permission was orally revoked on March 17, 1942. On April 2, 1942, the oral revocation was confirmed by a letter notifying the tenants that they, must cease to keep their dogs in the leased premises by May 1, 1942, or surrender the premises. The landlord accepted rent in advance for the month of April.\nIn announcing his finding for the plaintiff, the trial judge ordered a stay for thirty days for the purpose of affording a further opportunity to the tenants to comply with the terms of the lease and remove the dogs,* and ordered that if that were done the finding would be vacated. The tenants, however, did not avail themselves of this opportunity; but, instead, have perfected and prosecuted this appeal.\nBy designation of the appellee, the stenographic transcript of a former trial of the case before a different judge has found its way into the record. It does not belong there. It was not offered in evidence or considered by the trial judge. We have, accordingly, eliminated it from our consideration of the appeal. The second trial was also reported stenographically and the complete transcript is before us. Four errors aré assigned, which we shall consider and decide separately.\n(1) It is contended that there was error in holding that the breaches by the several defendants occurred on May 1, 1942, instead of March 17, 1942. Our examination of the record satisfies us that the breach occurred on May 1, 1942, which was the date fixed by the written demand of the landlord that dogs be removed from the premises. Plaintiff, therefore, had a right to rely upon said later date as the date of violation of the terms of the lease.\n(2) The second error assigned relates to acceptance of rent for the month of April, 1942. Our ruling on the first assignment of error disposes of this contention, for, undoubtedly, the landlord had a right to accept rent for the period during which the notice was running without waiving the breach, extending the tenancy, or losing its right to sue.\n(3) Appellants next complain that the trial judge excluded evidence of plaintiff’s statements . and conduct, allegedly showing an estoppel to revoke permission to possess dogs. We think the ruling was correct under the parol evidence rule. Under the terms of the lease it was at most a permissive right which could have been granted; obviously, therefore, there was a corresponding right to withdraw the permission at any time. In our. view the trial judge correctly ruled that such conversations, conduct, or verbal assurances could not be construed as constituting an advance waiver of Provision 9 of the lease. At most, such conversations could have given no greater right to the tenants than a subsequent permission to keep dogs; and such later permission, whether oral or in writing, was subject to revocation under the terms of the lease at the will of the landlord.\n(4) Appellants contend that the provisions of the District of Columbia Emergency Rent Act prohibited plaintiff from maintaining these proceedings. They claim to have had a privilege to possess dog's which was “frozen” by said Rent Act and which could, not be revoked by the landlord, although it is clear that all of them brought their dogs into the building after the effective. date of. said Act. They refer to Section 11(b) of the Act which defines services as “light, heat,” etc., “and any other privilege or facility connected with the use or occupancy of housing accommodations.”\nWe rule that, in the circumstances of this case, the right to keep dogs on the premises was neither a privilege nor a facility within the meaning of the Rent Act. We are satisfied that no rights of these tenants have been invaded, that there was a clear showing of a violation of the terms of the lease, and that the .judgment below was correct and should be\nAffirmed.\nByrne v.

UNITED STATES FIDELITY & GUARANTY CO.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""BARSE, Acting Associate Judge.\nThis was a suit in the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia, filed by ap-pellee against appellant to recover the sum of $97.85, with interest from August 27, 1940, representing loss alleged to have been sustained by appellee in having to pay a judgment .for costs rendered against appellant in the sum of $97.85 in certain proceedings in the Supreme Court of the state of New York, wherein appellant, as nonresident plaintiff, had given and filed a bond for costs upon which appellee was surety. The Municipal Court found in favor of appellee.\nAppellant did not submit to the trial judge, nor to opposing counsel, a “Statement of Proceedings and Evidence” as required by Rule 27 of this Court, nor was such a Statement or an agreed Statement in lieu thereof filed in this Court. Consequently, a motion to have the appeal docketed and dismissed under Rule 33 of this Court could have been, but was not, filed by appellee. There was set forth in the “Brief for Appellant” a “Statement of the Case”, and the “Brief for Appellee” contains a section entitled “Restatement of the Case”. Under all the circumstances,' — • particularly the fact that appellant appeared in proper person, both in the trial court and in this Court, — these Statements will be treated as part of the record on appeal, the appeal will be entertained, and the case will be decided upon its merits. However, the action of the Court in this respect should not be construed as a precedent for pending or future cases, and litigants and their attorneys are advised that this Court may, either upon appropriate motion, or sua sponte, dismiss an appeal where there has not been a compliance with the requirements of the Rules governing appeals to this Court.\nTo avoid duplication, the additional facts, to the extent deemed pertinent, will be referred to during the course of the opinion, incident to discussion of the issues presented.\n(1) Appellant says that the trial judge erred: “In denying defendant the right to plead his case and present his arguments in open court on May 22, May 25, and July 1, 1942. Instead, defendant, was enjoined to present his defense in writing.”\nTrial of the case upon the merits was begun on May 22, 1942. Appellee, by its counsel, presented in evidence, without objection; a copy of the cost bond, executed by appellant as principal and appellee as surety, together with a copy of the application for the bond; a certified copy of the judgment for costs, in the sum of $97.85, rendered by the Supreme Court of the state of New York against appellant in favor of Henry P. Fletcher, as Treasurer of the Committee for the Consideration of InterGovernmental Debts (one of the defendants in the State Court proceedings); a can-celled check in the sum of $97.85, endorsed by Coudert Brothers, attorneys for Fletcher; and a certificate of satisfaction of said judgment signed by Coudert Brothers, acknowledging payment and satisfaction of said judgment. Thereupon, appellant began to present his defense, at which point the trial judge intervened and suggested that appellant consider engaging the services of an attorney to represent him. Appellant assented, and, accordingly, the case was continued to May 25, 1942.\nUpon resumption of the trial on May 25th, appellant advised the trial judge “that he did not need any lawyer and wished to conduct his own defense.” Appellant had prepared a trial memorandum of considerable length containing his arguments and the allegations of fact upon which he intended to rely by way of defense. After appellant had begun oral presentation of his arguments, the trial judge suggested that appellant submit said trial memorandum for consideration by the Court, as constituting his defense. Appellant assented, appellee raised no objection, and the case was thereupon taken under advisement by the trial judge upon the bases of the evidence presented by ap-pellee in his case in chief, and the trial memorandum thus submitted on behalf of appellant.\nFinding in favor of plaintiff was rendered on June 23, 1942. Motion for new trial was duly filed, and hearing thereon was had on July 1, 1942, The case was thereupon again taken under advisement by the trial judge by agreement of the parties, upon the bases of the aforesaid evidence adduced by appellee and upon the defense set forth in said trial memorandum. The motion for new trial was overruled as of July 8, 1942.\nWe are satisfied that no error was committed by the trial judge under the foregoing procedure. It is obvious that he was impressed by the competitive disadvantage enuring to appellant in attempting to present his case without the benefit of counsel. In continuing the case in the middle of the trial on May 22d, for the purpose of enabling appellant to consider the employment of counsel and in receiving on May 25th, at face value, the carefully prepared trial memorandum of appellant without requiring appellant to produce evidence to sustain the factual allegations therein contained, the trial judge took unusual precautions and was actuated by a high sense of duty and fairness in thus endeavoring to assist appellant and to insure that his defense be presented with the maximum of intendments in favor of appellant, inasmuch as appellant was not represented by counsel. The trial memorandum thus submitted by appellant to the trial judge was tantamount, in legal effect, to the submission of stipulated facts for consideration and application to the issues presented, to the extent deemed legally relevant and pertinent by the trial judge in formulating his decision. Such submission was in open court, and appellant had his day in court.\n(2) Appellant also assigns error by the trial court: “In ignoring defendant’s contention about the existence of collusion and fraud in the claim made upon 'plaintiff in New York, which claim forms the substance of the action herein.”\nIn 1939 appellant, duly represented by counsel, brought suit in the Supreme Court of the state of New York against:\n1. Committee for the Consideration of Inter-Governmental Debts, an unincorporated association, and\n2. Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., as Permanent Chairman, and\n3. Henry P. Fletcher, as Treasurer of the Committee for the Consideration of Inter-Governmental Debts.\nIn certain preliminary proceedings, Sloan was eliminated from the case. On May 28, 1940, the case came on for trial on its merits, against Fletcher, who was represented by “Coudert Brothers”, attorneys. The court apparently made an oral ruling, during the course of the hearing on that day, to the effect that the case could not be maintained as to defendant Fletcher. Trial was resumed on May 29, 1940, and after hearing further evidence on behalf of appellant as plaintiff, the court apparently made a further oral ruling dismissing the case. On June 5, 1940, a final judgment was entered, formally dismissing the case and awarding costs against appellant and in favor of defendant Henry P. Fletcher as Treasurer of the Committee, etc., in the sum of $97.85.\nAppellant contends, inter alia, that the said judgment against him, in favor of Fletcher rather than in favor of the Committee, was obtained by collusion and fraud on the part of Fletcher’s lawyer and of appellant’s attorney, and that: “The wording- of the New York judgment as prepared by the Coudert lawyer is decidedly false and untrue to facts. The issues in Appellant’s action were raised on Wednesday, May 29, 1940 when Fletcher was no longer a litigant, and the said Fletcher as averred did not move at the close of Plaintiff’s evidence to dismiss the complaint — -for Fletcher was not then a defendant nor did he instruct his attorney to represent the Committee.” (“Brief for Appellant”, page 7.)\nNothing in the record, by way of factual allegations, sustains appellant’s contentions as to fraud and collusion. It is obvious that appellant, by reason of his lack of legal training and of familiarity with 'court procedure, misinterpreted the informal oral rulings of the court during the course of the trial on May 28-29, 1940, and considered said rulings to be formal and final dispositions of the New York case, first as to Fletcher and then as to the unincorporated committee. He concedes that the cost bond ran to Fletcher as Treasurer, etc., as one of the three obligees thereunder, but he failed to realize that the assessment of court costs is a matter for determination and allocation by the trial court. Said judgment of June 5, 1940, recites that the court costs had been: “adjusted on notice in the sum of $97.85”, and provides that: “defendant Plenry P. Fletcher as treasurer of the Committee for the Consideration of Inter-Governmental Debts recover of the plaintiff Wil-don Lloyd the sum of $97.85 costs as taxed * * *\nIf appellant considered that, as plaintiff in said New York proceedings, he had just ground of complaint as to the judgment therein rendered, his remedy was to obtain a review in the New York appellate courts. He cannot utilize the proceedings filed against him in this jurisdiction in the instant case, as a substitute for appellate proceedings in the state of New York. The trial memorandum of appellant discloses that he negotiated with another lawyer with reference to an appeal of the case but was unable to reach an agreement as to fees or a division of fees between the new attorney and his attorney of record in the case. In this connection, appellant states in said trial memorandum: “Under these conditions plaintiff decided that it would be too onerous to continue with the case, and let the appeal lapse. This was about July 3, 1940.”\nThe judgment of June 5, 1940, dismissing the case and awarding costs in the sum of $97.85 against appellant as plaintiff in that case thus became a final judgment and stands unreversed. As such, it was incumbent upon the trial judge in the instant case, as it is now incumbent upon this court, to give full and complete effect to said judgment under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution (Art. IV, sec. 1), inasmuch as it seems clear from the record that the New York court, in rendering said judgment, had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties and that appellant has raised no question as to such jurisdiction. See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, 18 L.Ed. 475; Richmond & D. R. Co. v. Gorman, 7 App.D.C. 91; Hieston v. National City Bank, 51 App.D.C. 394, 280 F. 525; Fidelity Storage Co. v. Urice, 56 App.D.C. 202, 12 F.2d 143; Williams v. State of North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287, 63 S.Ct. 207, 87 L.Ed. —, decided December 21, 1942.\n(3) Appellant further assigns error by the trial court: “In honoring as evidence for the plaintiff two documents: one insufficiently and deceitfully endorsed; and a copy of a New York judgment obtained by collusion and fraud.”\nThe contention of appellant in connection with this assignment of error is based upon the position erroneously taken by him concerning the preceding assignment of error just discussed, i. e., that the judgment of June 5, 1940, was obtained by collusion and fraud. Hence, appellant contends that the court was in error in admitting in evidence the certified transcript of said judgment and the cancelled check for $97.85 received and endorsed by the attorneys for Henry P. Fletcher in whose favor said judgment had been rendered as treasurer of the Committee for the Consideration of Inter-Governmental Debts.\nInasmuch as we have held that the record disclosed no evidence of fraud or collusion in the obtaining of said judgment of June 5, 1940, and further that it was incumbent upon the trial court and is likewise incumbent upon this court to give full faith and credit to said judgment, it follows that the trial court was not in error in receiving in evidence the certified copy of sa'id judgment and the cancelled check evidencing payment of said judgment by appellee as surety upon the cost bond.\nThe remaining assignments of error are without merit, are trivial in nature, and require no discussion.\nThe judgment of the trial court is therefore affirmed.\nAt the time of oral argument in this Court, and also by a notation on page 5 of the Transcript, appellant suggested that the original draft of said trial memorandum would be submitted to this Court for consideration if so desired. Accordingly, in line with this suggestion, and as authorized and contemplated under Rule 32 of this Court, the original of said trial memorandum has been obtained from appellant and has been lodged in the files of this Court as part of the Transcript of Record in this case, there to be retained for future reference, unless released by appropriate order."", 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'BARSE, Acting Associate Judge.'}], 'attorneys': ['Wildon Lloyd, pro se.', 'Thomas S.

ED. L. STOCK, Inc.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.\nPrior to December 31, 1940, Ed. L. Stock, Inc., a corporation, appellee herein, secured a judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against one Lepley, and thereafter filed a creditor’s bill against Lepley seeking discovery and collection of that judgment. In consideration of the discontinuance of the creditor’s suit, Louis Miller executed and delivered his promissory note in the sum of $300.00, dated December 31, 1940, with interest at 6% per annum, payable in monthly in-stalments of not less than $50.00 and interest. This note was made payable to the order of Edw. L. Stock, the president and chief stockholder of Ed. L. Stock, Inc. The note was executed by Miller as an accommodation for Lepley and was given as collateral security for the payment of the Lepley judgment and in consideration of the discontinuance of the creditor’s suit.\nThereafter appellee brought two actions upon the Miller note for collection of unpaid instalments. The first of such suits was settled and dismissed upon payment by Lepley in the presence of Miller of $53.00, $50.00 of which was applied to principal and $3.00 to interest. In the second suit, judgment was taken against Miller by default. The $53.00 payment, besides being credited on the Miller note, was likewise credited on the Lepley judgment.\nMiller having died, the present action was brought below against the administrator of his estate for the collection of the unpaid balance of the note. Jurisdiction of the lower court to entertain suit against an administrator is given by Section 4(a) of the Municipal Court Act of April 1, 1942.\nThe trial court awarded judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the unpaid balance of the note and from that judgment this appeal was taken. The case was submitted on briefs without argument.\nAppellant makes two main contentions, namely, (1) that appellee was not entitled to maintain this suit, and (2) absence of consideration for the note. In view of the two former suits, it is doubtful that either contention is timely made, but we shall nevertheless consider them.\nThe note was made payable to Edw. L. Stock and bore two indorsements, one “For Collection Account of Edward L. Stock,” and the other “Without recourse to me. Edw. L. Stock.” The indorsements were not dated and it is not evident from the note or the record which indorsement was first made. Appellant argues that the indorsements show the note to be the personal property of Edward L. Stock and that the corporation, therefore, had no right to bring suit upon the note. However, the corporation had possession of the note and had previously brought two actions upon it, and there was positive testimony that the note was its property. If the indorsement “Without recourse to me” is accepted as the controlling indorsement, appellee undoubtedly had a right to bring suit, for a note indorsed in blank may be negotiated by delivery. On the other hand, if we accept the indorsement “For Collection Account of Edward L. Stock” as the controlling indorsement, it constituted a restrictive indorsement, conferring upon the indorsee the right to bring any action that the indorser could bring. Under either indorsement appellee is plainly entitled to maintain the suit.\nWith respect to the contention of absence of consideration, appellant argues that since the note was payable to Stock personally and it was the corporation which dismissed its suit, no consideration existed for the giving of the note to Stock personally. In view of the fact that the note was executed by Miller in consideration of the dismissal of the suit against Lepley, it is not material whom the corporation designated as payee. The corporation could have taken the note payable to itself, to its agent or even to a total stranger, and likewise could have taken the note payable to itself and then indorsed it to anyone it pleased. The . consideration — the discontinuance of the creditor’s suit — remained the same.\nWe have examined the other points raised in appellant’s brief and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the lower court was correct and is therefore affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nPublic Law No. 512, 77tb Congress, 2d Sess., 56 Stat. 192.\nD.C.Code (1940) tit. 28, sec. 305.\nD.C.Code (1940) tit. 28, sec. 308.', 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.'}], 'attorneys': ['William Mazo and Morris Abrams, both of Washington, D.

KENNEDY-CHAMBERLIN DEVELOPMENT CO.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'CAYTON, Associate Judge.\nAppeal by plaintiff from a judgment entered against it on defendant’s counter claim for $485.98. Defendant was the general contractor in the construction of a home in Kenwood, Maryland. Plaintiff was the sub-contractor engaged to furnish the heating equipment. It was part of defendant’s responsibility to construct the chimney and flue for the home. It was plaintiff’s responsibility to furnish and install the pipe leading into the flue and to properly close it. After the house was occupied and the heating plant put into operation, it was found that a sooty substance was escaping into the house, causing damage. Each party claimed the work of the other had caused the damage.\nIn announcing his finding, the trial judge filed a memorandum opinion. He also filed a memorandum in connection with his ruling denying a new trial. Those two memo-randa, supplemented by a short statement of .proceedings and evidence, fully reveal what transpired at the trial. These we have examined with care in the light of the two grounds for reversal urged by appellant. They are:\n1. Alleged error of the trial judge in failing to find that defendant’s negligent construction of the chimney contributed to or concurred in causing the damage.\nThere was rather full testimony by both sides detailing the method of construction of the chimney by defendant, including the brick work and flue lining; as well as plaintiff’s method of installing the pipe leading into the chimney proper and the cause or causes of the escape of the sooty substance referred to. On this point the trial judge found:\n“The only conclusive testimony was that the sooty condition existed at one time and that after the chimney (should read: pipe) installation was corrected by the defendant such sooty condition was remedied. At the time of the trial I did not, and now do not, believe that I should guess as to the construction of the chimney itself.\n“Both sides introduced evidence as to tests made after the chimney had been completed, after the heating equipment had been installed, and as to tests made before the fault complained of had been remedied, and after it had been remedied. I took all of this evidence into account in making my findings. In consequence, and after considering all the evidence, I found that the connection between the heating plant and the chimney flue had not been constructed in a workmanlike manner and that such construction by the plaintiff was the proximate cause of introducing the sooty condition into the premises.”\nLooking to the record, we are satisfied that this finding not only was not “plainly wrong”, which would be necessary to justify a reversal, but was clearly supported by substantial evidence. That being so, we see no basis for reversal on the ground assigned since it concerns mere weight of evidence.\n2. Appellant contends that there was error in admitting evidence as to custom and usage relative to the construction of the chimney. On this point the trial judge stated that he made his finding, not upon the basis of the customary manner of installing such chimneys, “but upon the evidence introduced by both parties as to what actually happened in connection with this particular chimney.”\nIt seems clear that the evidence of custom and usage was not received for the purpose of altering the intent of the parties as expressed in their contract but to establish whether the contract had in fact been complied with. We think this evidence was proper as tending to explain the nature and extent of the performance by both parties, that it worked no prejudice to appellant and was properly considered and applied by the trial judge in connection with the other evidence in the case.\nAffirmed.\nPublic Law 512 — 77th Congress.\nCapital Apt.

STONEBRAKER.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nThis action for possession of an apartment was instituted by appellee as plaintiff in the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Municipal Court. The complaint alleged that defendant was occupying apartment No. 407 in the Harwill Apartments, 1835 K Street, N. W., holding over under a lease which had expired, and that the plaintiff, owner of the building, sought in good faith to recover possession for her immediate and personal use and occupancy as a dwelling. Defendant’s plea denied the allegation of good faith.\nTrial was by the court; a finding for plaintiff and judgment for possession resulted.\nPlaintiff’s evidence disclosed that for several years she had owned the Harwill Apartments, a building containing 63 housing units. She had lived, and continues to live, at Edgewater, Maryland, 35 miles from Washington. Her husband managed the apartment building and conducted a real estate and insurance business in a room on the first floor.\nThe Federal rationing of gasoline now makes it impossible for him to continue commuting from their home to his office, and for this reason they desire to occupy an apartment in this building.\nShe chose this particular apartment because of its location and exposure, and because she felt the occupant was the least desirable tenant in that tier.\nNotice to defendant to surrender possession, reciting plaintiff’s desire to occupy the premises, was served September 1, 1942. There were then no vacant apartments in the building. After September 1st another apartment was vacated but it was not of the type desired by plaintiff.\nPlaintiff’s husband\'corroborated her testimony.\nDefendant testified that in August plaintiff’s husband told him that plaintiff wanted the apartment vacated; that the apartment was occupied by defendant’s estranged wife and the reason given for the request to vacate was that her conduct as occupant was objectionable. Nothing then was said about plaintiff wanting the premises for her own occupancy. When the notice was served on September 1, giving a different reason for desiring possession, plaintiff’s husband said that the owner had to give the ground stated in the notice to get the occupant out of possession.\nThe District of Columbia Emergency Rent Control Act, excepts from its interdiction of possessory actions by a landlord the case of an owner who in good faith seeks recovery of his own property for immediate and personal use and occupancy as a dwelling. This provision was considered under comparable circumstances in our opinion in the case of Shaffer v. Bowes, D.C.Mun.App., 31 A.2d 690. We held that the Act “did not intend to prevent an owner from occupying his own premises, provided such • occupancy is sought in good faith and not for the purpose of evading or defeating the purposes of the Act. In such circumstances, where an owner has several properties available, the choice of which one he shall occupy is for ""him.”\nThat the rent of the selected premises is low when contrasted with that of similar housing units, the availability of other quarters, an objection to or even ill-will toward a particular tenant, are matters properly admitted in evidence as bearing upon the good faith of one seeking possession, under Section 5 of the Rent Control Act. But no one, or all in combination, necessarily constitute bad faith. They are items of evidence, to be considered by the court with the other evidence in the case.\nHere, giving due weight to the testimony of the defendant, the evidence as a whole gave ample support to the trial court’s finding of ""good faith on the part of the plaintiff, and the judgment must be affirmed.\nAffirmed. .\nPublic Law 327 — 77tb Congress, approved December 2, 1941, amended September 26, 1942, Public Law 716 — 77th Congress, now Title 46, Sec. 1601 et seq., D.C.Code (1940 Edition).', 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.'}, {'text': 'CAYTON, Associate Judge\n(concurring in result).\nI concur in the result; and refer to my separate opinion in Shaffer v.

JACKSON et al. JACKSON et al. v. KNOTT.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'HOOD, Associate Judge.\nPlaintiffs below, Walter A. Jackson, Rebecca M. Jackson, his wife, and Isabell Ware, sued the defendant, Dr. C. O. Knott, for the recovery of alleged usurious interest. The record discloses that in February, 1937, Mr. Jackson sought a loan from Dr. Knott and offered as security a third deed of trust on his home, but the loan was refused on the ground the security offered was insufficient. Later Mr. Jackson, with the consent of his aunt, Isabell Ware, again approached Dr. Knott and offered a second deed of trust on Mrs. Ware’s house as additional security for the loan. Dr. Knott examined her house and approved a loan. The record does not disclose the amount of the loan originally sought nor the amount finally agreed upon but on March 10, 1937 Mr. and Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Ware executed a joint and several note, payable to the order of Marie Toombs, in the principal amount of $980, with interest at 6% per annum, principal and interest being payable in monthly installments of $40 each. This note was secured by a single deed of trust executed by the three makers of the note and covering both the Jackson and Ware homes.\nIt was contended by plaintiffs, and not denied by defendant, that the payee of the note was but a straw party for Dr. Knott; and though the principal amount of the note was $980 it is conceded by all parties that the amount actually advanced by Dr. Knott was only $697.90. The latter amount was advanced by Dr. Knott in the following amounts and for the following purposes: a check for $112.50 to Mr. Sager as payment on a second trust on the property of the Jacksons, a check for $120.00 to the Bank of Commerce & Savings in payment of a debt of Mr. Jackson, a check for $37.43 to L. P. Stewart to pay a bill owed by Mr. Jackson, checks for $72.74 and $65.01 in payment of taxes on the Jacksons’ property, a check for $68.06 in payment of taxes on the Ware property, a check for $209.19 in payment of a bill owing by Mrs. Ware, and the balance in cash which was handed to Mrs. Jackson. The record offers no explanation why the payments were made in the manner above stated rather than by one check to the plaintiffs, though apparently it was by agreement of all parties.\nThe note and deed of trust were executed in the office of Herman E. Miller, an attorney representing Dr. Knott. Dr. Knott paid him the sum of $50 on account of expenses and fees in this transaction.\nThereafter, up to and including February 8, 1939, the sum of $555.30 was paid on account of the note, $476.34 being applied to principal and $78.96 to interest. This sum was paid by Mr. Jackson and Mrs. Ware, but neither could testify as to the exact amount he or she paid, though Mrs. Ware testified that she paid more than Mr. Jackson.\nOn March 24, 1939, Mrs. Ware paid the sum of $300, $297.48 being applied to principal and $2.52 to interest. The record does not disclose expressly why she made this payment, how the particular sum was determined, or the negotiations or conversations leading up to the making of the payment. However, upon the making of this payment Mrs. Ware’s property was released from the deed of trust given to secure the note.\nThereafter Jackson continued to make various payments upon the note until December 4, 1941, when the note was paid in full.\nObviously the transaction was usurious and the defendant below made no contention to the contrary. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $330.82. This sum was arrived at by adding the sum of $98.72, the interest charged on the note, and the principal amount of $980, making -a total of $1,078.72, and deducting therefrom $697.90, the amount actually advanced, plus the $50 payment to Miller.\nThe defendant appealed from the judgment entered on that verdict and the plaintiffs have taken a cross-appeal.\nThe cross-appeal is based upon the refusal of the trial court to rule that the case came within the provisions of the so-called Loan Shark Law, which provides that the person violating the provisions of the act shall forfeit all interest, and in addition thereto shall forfeit a sum equal to one-fourth of the principal sum. We think the trial court was correct in this ruling. The Loan Shark Law is not a usury statute, but an act licensing, under limitations and restrictions, the lending of money in .small sums upon personal security; and was intended to apply only to persons making small loans upon personal security as shown by the fact that the amount of such loans is limited by the act to $200. The actual amount loaned in this case, nearly $700, can hardly be called a small loan and is far above the figure fixed by the act.\nIn an attempt to bring this case within the act, plaintiffs below offered the testimony of one Lewis, who identified four notes representing loans from Knott to the witness, in amounts varying from $30 to $93, made between November 14, 1936, and July 20, 1938. Such evidence, plus the making of the loan here in issue, is not sufficient to warrant a finding that Knott was engaged “in the business of loaning money” within the meaning of the act. Plaintiff also offered in evidence other notes payable to Marie Toombs but since the witness testified that -Marie Toombs lent money herself, the court properly refused to admit those notes in evidence against Knott.\nThe contention made in the main appeal, in substance, is that a claim for the return of usury is a personal right and that to maintain a joint action for usury there must be proof of joint payment or payment out of joint funds, that since there was no proof in this case of either joint payments or payment from joint funds the plaintiffs below could not maintain a joint action; that Mrs. Jackson, made no actual payments and therefore could not maintain a separate action; that Mr. Jackson did not prove that he paid more than he actually received and therefore could not maintain a separate action; and that Mrs. Ware was the only one who might have claimed usury but that her cause of action is barred by the one year limitation of our usury statute.\nOur Code provision, § 28 — 2704, relating to the recovery of usury paid, provides that if a person shall take or receive unlawful interest, the person “paying the same shall be entitled to sue for and recover the amount of the unlawful interest so paid,” provided said suit be begun within one year from the date of such payment.\nAppellant cites a number of cases to the effect that usury can be recovered only by the party paying it. Illustrative of these cases is Kendall v. Vanderlip, 2 Mackey, D.C., 105, where an accommodation maker, when sued on the note, attempted to sqt off usurious interest paid by the party accommodated, whose name did not appear on the note, and the court, denying such right of set-off, said: “Now, in this case, the illegal interest was paid by Terry, for whose accommodation these notes were made, not by the maker of the notes; and it is very plain that the maker cannot maintain a suit against Kendall to recover money paid by Terry, a third party, out of his own pocket.”\nThe case most heavily relied upon by appellant is that of Timberlake et al. v. First National Bank, 5 Cir., 43 F. 231, 235, where suit was brought to recover alleged usury, and on a demurrer to the pleas the court said: “The fifth plea alleges that T. C. King & Co. were the successors of Timberlake & Nance, and that whatever amount of interest was paid, if any, over and above the interest allowed by law, was paid by T. C. King & Co., who alone are entitled to recover the penalty therefor. Section 5198 [12 U.S.C.A. § 86] confers the right to recover the penalty to the party paying it, or tó his legal representatives, so that this plea sets up a valid defense to this action if sustained by the proof.”\nOther cases of a similar nature are cited by appellant. These cases hold that one cannot recover usury not paid by him and consequently that one joint maker cannot recover illegal interest when it was paid by the other maker. And in some of the cases it is held that where one joint maker pays all the illegal interest he may sue therefore in a separate action without joining his co-maker as a co-plaintiff. But such cases, in our opinion, do not sustain the proposition that joint makers of a note may not maintain a joint suit for recovery of usury. Plainly one joint maker should not be allowed to recover that which he did not pay, since his co-maker, not being a party to the action, might also sue and thus force defendant to pay twice for the same usury. In the present case, all parties to the note are in court and defendant cannot be prejudiced by a joint judgment. One determination of the usury paid has been made, and one judgment entered. Defendant will be compelled to pay that judgment and no more.\nThe case most nearly in point, relied upon by appellees and conceded by appellant to be contrary to his contention, is that of Alston et al. v. Orr, Tex.Civ.App., 105 S. W. 234, 236. In that case, three brothers applied for a loan which defendant agreed to make, provided their father would sign the note with them. The father and sons signed a joint and several note but the father received no money and made no payments on the note and the illegal interest was paid by the three sons at different times and in different amounts. The father and sons joined in an action to recover double the amount of the illegal interest as provided by the Texas statute. The trial court ruled that there was -a variance between the allegations and proof but this ruling was reversed on appeal, where the court said:\n“We conclude from the foregoing that all of the appellants were necessary parties to this suit, and must join in this action. * * * Under the allegations in the petition, it was competent to show the payments by any or all of the plaintiffs. It was not alleged that each of the plaintiffs paid any certain amount, but the allegation was general that the plaintiffs made the following payments, setting them out. We think this allegation could have been met by proof that the payment on any particular day had been made by one of the plaintiffs acting for all, or by any two or more of them. Their obligation being joint, any payment made by either would enure to the benefit of all. 4 Am. & Eng.Ency.Law. (2d Ed.) p. 497, and authorities cited.\n“The alleged agreement of plaintiffs among themselves, above set out, as to the division and use of the money among three of them, and that each of said three should pay the stipulated interest on the amount each used, and should pay back to Orr that proportion of the principal, could not alter the nature of the written instrument, which imposed a joint obligation upon all of them. Nor did the separate payments by any one of them release him from his joint and several liability for the balance due. The note being joint and several, so far as the payee was concerned, he could hold all the makers jointly and severally liable for the full amount, regardless of the payments each one had made, and any agreement relative to the division of liability thereon by the appellants inter se could not affect the question. So that in our judgment it necessarily follows that any payment made by one of the plaintiffs inured to the benefit of all, and was in law a payment by all of them; and this was but the effect of the allegation in plaintiffs’ petition and the proof fully conformed thereto, so that there was not, in our judgment, any variance. The judgment of the court instructing a verdict for the defendant on the ground of a variance was error, for which the judgment must be reversed.”\nWe believe the reasoning of the above case applies to the instant case, particularly in view of the fact that the parties here, related by marriage or blood, executed a joint and several note, secured by a joint deed of trust on the two properties, the proceeds of the note were used by them under an apparent joint agreement and payments were made by the parties in varying amounts apparently pursuant to some joint arrangement between them.\nAll three makers of the note were jointly and severally liable for the full amount and payments made by one enured to the benefit of the other as far, at least, as the holder of the note was concerned. What private arrangement existed between the makers of the note as to the division of the proceeds of the note or the repayment thereof does not appear; nor do we think it material as far as the lender is concerned. While Mrs. Jackson actually made no payments on the note, she was jointly and severally liable thereon, property owned by her and her husband was given as security for the payment of the loan and she was in all respects an essential party to the note. We conclude under these circumstances the three joint makers had the right to maintain a joint suit and to obtain a joint judgment for the usury admittedly paid, even though they could not show exactly what amount each had individually paid.\nThere remains the question of the one year limitation provided by the act. Appellant’s position in this regard is that Mrs. Ware, upon the payment of $300, was finally released from all obligation under the note, and that as a consequence her claim is barred by the limitation of the act. As previously stated, when Mrs. Ware made the $300 payment in March, 1939, her property was released from the deed of trust. It does not necessarily follow, however, that she was released from further obligation under the note. There was no evidence that she made the payment in order to be released from personal liability or that Knott agreed that she would be released upon making the payment, or that he told her at any time that she was released. He gave her no writing to that effect and it is significant that, while the note bore an endorsement by the trustee that the Ware property was released from the deed of trust securing the note, there was no notation made upon the note of any release of personal liability of Mrs. Ware.. The only evidence regarding a release of Mrs. Ware from further liability on the note is her testimony that when she paid the $300 she was “finished”, and that thereafter she was asked for no further payments, and Dr. Knott’s testimony that when the $300 payment was made he cancelled the signature of Mrs. Ware by drawing a line through it, but he did not testify that he did that in the presence of Mrs. Ware or that he did it for the purpose of releasing her from further liability. The original note, produced here under Rule 32(c), discloses an indistinct line drawn through Mrs. Ware’s signature. Dr. Knott testified that he drew lines through the other two signatures when the note was finally paid, that he presumed all the lines were made with the same ink and the same pen and that he was using the same ink in 1941 that he used in 1939. Under these circumstances, we think it was proper for the, trial court to submit to the jury the question, as hereinafter discussed, of whether or not Dr. Knott had actually released Mrs. Ware from further personal liability on the note at the time she made the $300 payment.\nAgain appellant asserts that since Mrs. Ware made no payments after March, 1939, she is barred by the one year limitation, regardless of whether she was released in 1939. The jury, by its verdict, has found that she was not released in 1939, and under the authority of Alston et al. v. Orr, supra, payments made by any of the parties were made on behalf of all, and under the authority of Brown v. Slocum, 30 App.D.C. 576, and Von Rosen v. Dean, 59 App.D.C. 359, 41 F.2d 982, the action to recover back usurious interest can only be maintained after the last payment on the debt has been made. The last payment in the instant case was made in December, 1941, and consequently the suit was brought within the time limited by the statute.\nThe trial court ruling, as a matter of law, that the transaction was usurious, submitted to the jury two questions only, namely, whether Mrs. Ware was in fact released from her obligation at the time of making the $300 payment, and whether . the $50 payment to Miller was a proper charge against the borrowers. By its verdict the jury found that she was not released and that the charge was proper. We think these two questions were properly submitted to the jury. The evidence as to what transpired at the time of the making of the $300 payment was neither positive nor direct. From such evidence the jury might have found, as evidently it did, that the purpose of the $300 payment was to obtain a release of Mrs. Ware’s property from the deed of trust and not to obtain a release from further personal obligation on the note. As to the $50 charge, Miller testified that it was a payment to him for handling the transaction, including the preparation of the note and deed of trust and recording charges, and the record states that on cross-examination he itemized the figures making up that amount. As far as the record discloses, these charges were not excessive nor made as a cloak for usury, and the jury, by its verdict, found this to be a proper charge against the plaintiffs.\nWe find no error in the record and accordingly in both the appeal and cross-appeal the judgment below is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nRICHARDSON, Chief Judge:\nI agree with the foregoing opinion except as to the construction of that part of the Code, Section 28 — 2704, requiring that when usury is paid “suit be begun within one year from the date of such payment”.\nThe transaction was usurious because at the time of the loan the lender deducted a discount or commission of $232.19, taking a note for $980.00 for the loan of $747.90.\nAll payments on account of the note, whether credited by the holder as principal or interest, are required to be applied to the repayment of the actual indebtedness. The payment of $300.00 by the appellee Ware on March 24, 1939 (the suit was filed April 15, 1942) discharged the original debt and included $27.00 of usurious interest. At that time a cause of action to recover usury accrued under the statute.\nSubsequently, at various times during the remainder of 1939, 1940 and 1941, payments were made by the appellee Jackson. These payments were of usury, but only two (that of $15.00 on July 3, 1941 and $47.56 on December 4, 1941) were made within the one year period. I think the recovery should have been limited to these two payments. I am aware that this conclusion may seem at variance with the language of the opinion in Brown v. Slocum, 30 App.D.C. 576, 577, decided March 10, 1908. The following considerations, however, impel me to this decision.\nIn Brown v. Slocum the question now before us was not involved. In that case a note of $183.60 was executed October 31, 1905 payable in twelve equal monthly installments of $15.30 beginning January 4, 1906. $48.60 was deducted as a commission. The borrower received $135.00. The opinion states:\n“the sum deducted was usurious under the law, but, inasmuch as it was paid more than one year before suit for its recovery was begun, appellant insists that recovery is barred by the statute of limitations.”\nWhen the suit was filed on February 20, il907, ten of the twelve payments had been made within the year. The two prior payments had repaid $30.60 of the amount loaned. It was not until nine payments had been made, or until September 4, 1906, that the sum actually loaned was repaid. All usurious payments were made less than six months before suit.\nThe court relied upon and quoted a portion of the opinion by Justice Harlan in McBroom v. Scottish Mortg. & Land Inv. Co., 153 U.S. 318, 328, 14 S.Ct. 852, 856, 38 L.Ed. 729, 733, in which a 10% deduction from the amount of a loan had been applied as a commission when the loan was granted. In that case the principal note was payable in one payment in six years and had not matured when the action was brought. The quotation from this opinion was in part as follows:\n“Interest cannot be said to have been collected or received in excess of what may be lawfully collected and received until the lender has, in fact after giving credit for all payments, collected or received more than the sum loaned, with legal interest. Such, in our judgment, is the true construction of the statute of New Mexico. In this view, the limitation of three years, within which the borrower may sue for double the amount of usurious interest collected and received from him, does not commence to run, and, therefore, the cause of action does not accrue, until the lender has actually collected or received more than the original debt, with legal interest.”\nApplying this rule in Brown v. Slocum, the court held that all payments made upon a note tainted with usury must be applied on the actual amount loaned until it is paid in full.\nThe further statement by the court: “We think her cause of action did not accrue until the last payment was made,” was not only immaterial to the decision of the case but was apparently inadvertent.\nIf the appellee had refused to make the last payment on her note it is unthinkable that she would not have had a cause of action on account of her prior payments of usury. The court did not so intend. This was obvious when it said:\n“There could be no usurious interest collected until the appellee had paid the full amount she received, together with legal interest. This time did not occur until within less than a year of the bringing of this suit.”\nLater in Von Rosen v. Dean, 59 App.D.C. 359, 41 F.2d 982, 983, the court paraphrased its language in Brown v. Slocum, supra, but added, after the words “the last payment was made” the qualifying clause “on the debt on which usury was charged.”\nWhat was “the debt on which usury was charged”? I think the Supreme Court answered that question in the quotation repeated in Brown v. Slocum when it said:\n“The cause of action does not accrue, until the lender has actually collected or received more than the original debt.”\nThat limitations of action commence to run from the accrual of the cause of action is a rule of universal application and I can discover nothing in the statute or in reason to justify departure from a settled principle of law.\nIn McCarthy v. First National Bank, 233 U.S. 493, 32 S.Ct. 240, 241, 56 L.Ed. 523 (affirming 23 S.D. 269, 121 N.W. 853, 23 L.R.A.,N.S., 335, 21 Ann.Cas. 437) decided February 19, 1912, four years after Brown v. Slocum, it was held that the two year limitation imposed on suits for usury against national banks by Sec. 5198, R.S.U. S., 12 U.S.C.A. § 86. included only interest paid within two years prior to suit if paid and received as such. The court, said that “the statute does not begin to run from the date of the loan, nor from the date of the satisfaction of the debt, but from the date interest is paid”. The note in that case had extended over a long period of years, during which usurious interest had been paid. The principal had been paid less than two years before suit. The defense was that payments of usury antedating the two years were barred by the statute. This was so ruled by the state court. In affirming, the Supreme Court said in part:\n“In considering the bank’s plea that the action was barred because not brought within two years, and the plaintiff’s claim that the statute only ran from the date the debt was paid, the supreme court of South Dakota pointed out the irreconcilable conflict in the cases dealing with this question, and after making careful analysis of all the authorities, reached the conclusion, in which we concur, that the statute begins to run from the date of the payment of the usurious interest.\n^ ‡ ‡ ‡ Í\n“But when the debtor actually makes a payment as interest and the bank knowingly receives and appropriates it as such, the usurious transaction is complete, the right of the one and the liability of the other is fixed, the cause of action arises, and the statute of limitations begins to run. There is no locus penitentiae. That privilege is only granted to those banks which, having charged usury, may by a refusal to accept interest when tendered, show that they will not carry the illegal contract into execution, and thus escape the twofold penalty.\n“Those courts which hold that the statute begins to run from the payment of the debt, instead of the payment of the interest, have been influenced by statements of Mr. Justice Harlan in McBroom v. Scottish Mortg. & Land Inv. Co., 153 U.S. 318, 14 S.Ct. 852, 38 L.Ed. 729, which involved the construction of the usury statute of the territory of New Mexico. That act differed in several respects from Rev.Stat. § 5198. But that case did not rule that in a suit under the act of Congress, the statute did not run from the date usury was paid and received as such. This court did not understand that such was the meaning of that case, as appears from his opinion in Brown v. Marion Nat. Bank, 169 U.S. 416, 18 S.Ct. 390, 42 L.Ed. 801, which involved a construction. Rev.Stat. § 5198. For he there points out the difference between ‘paying’ and ‘agreeing to pay,’ and says that, ‘if at any time the obligee actually pays usurious interest, as such the usurious transaction must be held to have then, and not before, occurred, and he must sue within two years thereafter.’\n“The Supreme Court of South Dakota properly held that the recovery of interest paid more than two years before suit was brought was barred, and its judgment is affirmed.”\nTwo points are clear from this decision. First, that payments of usurious interest do not constitute a running account to justify inclusion of barred payments upon the theory that the limitation commences to run from the date of the last payment. Second, that an immediate cause of action accrues for each definitely usurious payment.\nIn Baker v. Moultrie Banking Company, 53 Ga.App. 107, 184 S.E. 894, 896, the court said:\n“A suit to recover usury must be brought within twelve months from the payment thereof. * * * The date when paid and the amount must be shown. Each act of usury gives rise to a separate cause of action. Different acts may be included in one suit, under the Code § 3-113, which allows claims between the same parties to be joined in the same action. A running account is not barred if the last item is not barred. The present suit is not for an accounting, but is for separate acts of usury.” (Italics supplied.)\nIn the present case there is no mutuality or reciprocity of credits and debits which would constitute a running account. Usury was paid by the appellees, but a part of it was paid more than one year before the suit was brought. I think the recovery should have been limited to the amounts paid within the year.\nD.C.Code 1940, §§ 26—601 to 26—611.\nReagan v. District of Columbia, 41 App.D.C. 409, 412.\nYon Rosen v.

SOWDER et al.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nThis suit was for damages to appellants’ trees and shrubbery caused by the intrusion of appellee Sowder’s automobile into appellants’ front yard. Defendants in the suit were appellee Sowder and appellee W. H. Hessick & Sons, Inc.\nA second suit, not before us on this appeal, was filed by Sowder against Hes-sick for damage to the Sowder car.\nBoth suits resulted from a collision of automobiles of the respective appellees at the intersection of Reno Road and Davenport Street, on the southwest corner of which appellants’ residence is located. The Sowder car, going west on Davenport Street, was deflected from its course by the impact of the Hessick car, going south on Reno Road, resulting in the invasion of appellants’ premises.\nThe negligence of the Hessick driver was an issue in both cases. Having in common this issue of fact, the two cases were consolidated for trial and heard by the court without a jury.\nAppellants, as plaintiffs, offered evidence showing the presence of the Sowder car on their premises and the extent of the damage caused by it. At the conclusion of their evidence, the appellee Hessick moved for the entry of a finding in his favor in appellants’ action upon the ground that no evidence of negligence in the operation of his car had been offered. The court ruled that it would defer action on the motion “until the other case is in.”\nThereupon Sowder produced testimony directed to the issue of negligence of the driver of the Hessick car, and Hessick offered evidence in rebuttal.\nThis evidence may be briefly summarized. The two streets at the intersection of which the collision occurred are of equal width. Reno Road is a boulevard street, traffic on which is given preference. On Davenport Street, twelve feet back of the intersection and facing westbound traffic, is a “Stop” sign. From this point an automobile on Reno Road approaching from the right is visible for about one hundred feet from the intersection.\nThe collision occurred about 7:30 o’clock on the evening of December 13, 1941. At the time it was foggy, visibility was poor, and the streets were wet.\nThe driver of the Sowder car stopped three feet back of the traffic sign, looked to right and left, did not see approaching traffic, and proceeded across the intersection. She testified that she did not see the Hessick car until it was about ten feet away, a second before the impact of its front against the right front door of her car. She did not say whether she looked again for approaching traffic after starting from the point three feet back of the sign. She was unable to say whether the lights on her car were the bright, dim, or parking lights.\nThe driver of the Hessick car testified that his speed was twenty-five miles per hour; that he did not see the Sowder car until its front fender came into the radius of his headlights, and it was then impossible to avoid the collision. He states that the only lights showing on the Sowder car were those on the dashboard and the parking light. A neighbor, hearing the crash, arrived at the scene when the driver of the Sowder car was being lifted out of her seat. He testified that the headlights of the Sowder car were not on at that time and that later he saw another neighbor turn off the dash and parking lights.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence the trial judge stated that in his opinion the driver of the Sowder car was not “careful enough in entering that intersection” and “proceeded on without being able to take proper precaution”; that on the other 'hand, the driver of the Hessick car “was going too fast into that intersection at twenty-five, miles per hour.” But he concluded that neither driver was negligent and entered findings for both defendants.\nAppellee Hessick claims that his motion for a finding should have been granted at the conclusion of the evidence submitted by appellants, or at the conclusion of the whole case upon consideration of appellants’ evidence. He insists that the finding should have been predicated upon appellants’ evidence alone, and that the evidence adduced by the other parties should not have been considered. In taking this stand, however, he fails to recognize the realities presented when cases of this kind are consolidated for trial and heard together.\nThe objects of such consolidations are to save the repetition of testimony,and the delays and expense incident to several trials of a common issue of fact. This is well illustrated in the case of Burke v. Hodge, 211 Mass. 156, 97 N.E. 920, 921, Ann.Cas.1913B, 381, where three workmen were injured by the falling of a wall. Each sued separately his employer and the contractor. The six suits were consolidated for trial. In approving this action of the presiding judge the court stated that “in the interest of economy of time and expense” the practice of consolidating actions “depending in great degree upon the same evidence” had been recognized for many years. No useful purpose would have been served if any one case had been required to stand alone upon its own evidence.\nIn our opinion the effect of a consolidation of cases for trial is to dispose of a common issue in one hearing, thereby avoiding several trials. Parties asserting the affirmative of the common issue are in legal effect united as plaintiffs. The issue is to be determined upon consideration of the evidence as a whole of those holding the affirmative, and the court cannot segregrate the evidence and, as to one plaintiff, decide the common issue as to him upon his evidence alone. We think the court was right in postponing consideration of the motion for a finding in favor of the appellee Hessick until Sowder’s evidence had been submitted.\nThe alleged error relied upon by appellants involves (1) an apparent inconsistency between the findings of the trial court and its conclusions, and (2) whether the ultimate finding was justified by the evidence.\nThis ultimate finding of the trial judge was that the collision was an unavoidable accident.\nThe usual definition of “unavoidable accident” is stated by Judge Urner of the Maryland Court of Appeals as follows : “An unavoidable accident, as a subject of judicial inquiry, is one which could not have been obviated by the exercise of legally requisite care by any of the persons whose responsibility for the occurrence is asserted or denied. If either the plaintiff or defendant could have averted the accident by proper care, it could not 'be said to have been unavoidable.”\nIn view of the specific findings of lack of care on the part of both appellees, based upon substantial evidence, the ultimate conclusion was obviously in error, unless as to one or the other the court had further found that their negligence was not a contributing cause of the collision. Apparently the latter was not considered by the trial court and we cannot determine it on this appeal.\nThe judgment is reversed and the case remanded with instructions to grant a new trial.\nReversed.\nFirst Nat.

NOWELL et al.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'RICHARDSON, Chief Judge.\nFour separate actions were brought by the United States as plaintiff against the several defendants as makers of certain installment notes held by the Federal Hous ing Administration. Default in payment had occurred in each case and judgments were entered by the trial court by consent of the appellee Nowell and by default in the other cases for the unpaid balances of principal and interest.\nThe issue presented in this appeal arose on the disallowance by the trial court in each case of the item of attorney’s fees claimed by the plaintiff under the terms of the respective notes. In the Nowell case counsel for the defendant opposed the allowance of an attorney’s fee by the trial court. The objection was sustained and the disallowance noted in the judgment. In entering default judgments in the other three cases attorney’s fees were also denied.\nUpon motion in this court the four cases were consolidated.\nThe notes in suit in Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in identical language provide:\n“The maker or makers further agree * * * if this note or any installment thereon is not paid at its maturity, to pay all costs of collection including cost of suit and fifteen per cent of the amount in default as an attorney’s fee. This note is made in accordance with the provisions of the National Housing Act and under regulations of the Federal Housing Administration.” (Italics supplied.)\nThe Nowell note, evidencing a Maryland transaction, contains the following clause: “The maker or makers, * * * hereby authorize and (any) court in Maryland or elsewhere, to enter judgment hereon by confession before, at, or after maturity, against us, jointly or severally, in favor of the holder for the unpaid balance, including interest, costs and an attorney’s fee of ten per centum, expressly waiving summons or other process.” (Italics supplied.)\nOn the face of the note appear the words: “Modernization Loan under National Housing Act.”\nThe four notes represent loans made by banking institutions for the modernizing of homes under Title I of the National Housing Act of June 27, 1934, 48 Stat. 1246, c. 847, 12 U.S.C.A. § 1701 et seq., as amended.\nNotice of this fact, if specific evidence of such notice be required, was given by the above quoted language of the notes. In interpreting the provisions of these notes they must be considered in the light of this legislation, the regulations promulgated by its authority, and the executive action in carrying out its provisions.\nTitle I of the Act provides, § 2(a) for the insurance of approved private financial institutions against losses sustained as a result of loans made to home owners for the purpose of financing alterations, repairs and improvements, subject to the following among other conditions: “The total liability which may be outstanding at any time plus the amount of claims paid in respect of all insurance heretofore and hereafter granted under this section and section 6, as amended, less the amount collected from insurance premiums and other sources and deposited in the Treasury of the United States under the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, shall not exceed in the aggregate $165,000,000.”\nSection 2(c) (1) authorizes the Administrator to collect, compromise or sell any .evidence of debt or security assigned to him in connection with the payment of insurance “until such time as such obligations may be referred to the Attorney General for suit or collection.”\nSection 2(f) provides for the deposit of all moneys received from the collection of such debts in a special account of the Federal Housing Administration in the Treasury of the United States, which account is made available for the payment of the operating expenses of the Administration under Title I and the payment of claims in connection with insurance under that title.\nSection 1 of the Act provides that the Administrator may “utilize such Federal officers and employees, and, with the consent of the State, such State and local officers and employees, and appoint such other officers and employees as he may find necessary, and may prescribe their authorities, duties, responsibilities, and tenure and fix their compensation, without regard to the provisions of other laws applicable to the employment or compensation of officers or employees of the United States.”\nPursuant to these several provisions of Title I the Federal Housing Administration acts as an insurer of what are termed “modernization” loans, enabling approved banks and financial institutions throughout the United States to extend credit upon the personal responsibility of home owners who without security might otherwise be subjected to excessive discounts and financial charges. This function established under the provisions of Title I of the Act is made a separate unit of the Federal Housing Administration and its financial operations are expressly segregated not only by the limitation of the total fund to be employed, but by the creation of a special account in the Treasury in which all receipts are to be deposited and out of which expenses and insurance claims are payable.\nUnder the authority of Section 1 the Administrator may utilize Federal officers and employees and fix compensation without regard to limitations imposed by other laws applicable to their employment or’ compensation. Such compensation must be paid out of the foregoing special account. Section 2(c) (1) contemplates that when other means of collection of notes taken over by the Administration under its insurance plan are unavailing they are to be referred to the Attorney General for suit. In employing the services of the Attorney General to this end, including of course the law officers of his department, the Administrator has fixed his annual compensation or fee at $50,000, which amount has been paid each year including the fiscal year commencing July 1, 1942.\nThis charge against the funds available for the purposes specified in Title I of the Federal Housing Act is directly attributable to cases such as those now in suit. The question here therefore is not whether the Federal Government may recover under an attorney’s fee provision in a promissory note because of its payment of salaries to attorneys employed in its legal departments, but whether the payment of a specific sum out of a special fund, by one Government instrumentality to the Department of Justice for legal services may be regarded as the payment of an “attorney’s fee”.\nTransactions between different branches of Government may result in legal consequences similar to those which would arise between individuals.\nIn United States v. State of New York, 160 U.S. 598, 16 S.Ct. 402, 411, 40 L.Ed. 551, the state furnished in an emergency money which the United States was liable to reimburse. State officials borrowed the amount from a special fund which the law required to be invested at interest, and thereafter paid equivalent interest out of its general funds. This, it was held, created an obligation on the part of the United States to repay not only the principal but the interest so paid, the court recognizing the creation of a legal obligation as between different branches of the State Government. It was not, the court said, “the case of the state taking money out of one pocket to supply a deficiency in another”.\nThe validity of stipulations in promissory notes for the payment of attorney’s fees in the event of default has been upheld in Maryland and is supported by the weight of decision in the State and Federal Courts. It has been universally recognized in this jurisdiction in our trial courts and inferentially by our Court of Appeals in the case of Lockwood v. Lindsey, 6 App.D.C. 396.\nSuch provisions, however, are sustained only as an indemnity for the reasonable fees necessarily and properly paid or incurred. Tire question of what constitutes a reasonable fee depends upon the circumstances of each case. If the court deems it necessary, or if either party desires, testimony may be taken as to the nature of the services rendered, and the reasonable value thereof.\nTo guard against possible oppression and injustice this rule must apply, although defendant defaults; for this is but a reasonable exercise of the power of a trial judge to prevent allowance of excessive fees. But here the question of reasonableness was never reached, because the trial judge, upon the record as presented, refused to allow any attorney’s fee.\nWe deem it unnecessary to pass upon the question whether if a note had been the property generally of the United States and the suit for its collection prosecuted by public officers, compensated by salary, an attorney’s fee would be recoverable. We decide that under the circumstances of this case, where the note belongs to a special fund to which its proceeds will go, where fees have been paid for the services of counsel in bringing the suit, which will be partly reimbursed by the allowance, the appellant is entitled to recover a reasonable fee, to be fixed by the trial court.\nThe judgments, as to the disallowance of attorney’s fees, will be reversed and the cases remanded with instructions to the trial court to allow a reasonable attorney’s fee in each case in accordance with the foregoing opinion.\nReversed.\n“Federal Loan Agency, Federal Housing Administration, Dr.\nTo Department of Justice\nDate of Amount\nDelivery Articles or Services Dollars cents\nAdvance of funds to cover cost of collection activities and other service in connection with defaulted notes acquired by the Fed-Fiscal eral Housing Administration as the result of payment of insured\nYear losses to Financial Institutions under the provisions of Title I, $60,000 00\n1943 Section 2, of the National Housing Act, and Amendments, and referred to the Department for action.\nTotal $50,000 00”\nThe above voucher is the one for the current year and evidences the method of payment.\nAs to the right of the court to take judicial notice the essential matters referred to, see Shapleigh et al. v.

Their claim was that the basement had become flooded due to defective construction and failure to waterproof the walls. The substance of the testimony was that plaintiffs had bought the home sometime in December, 1940 and had occupied it m the early part of January, 1941; that after living there about a month and a half the basement became flooded as the result of a rain storm and that this happened on various subsequent occasions. This was new property built by defendant and had not been previously occupied. Plaintiffs claimed that the president of the defendant company visited the premises and promised “to take care of the matter”. This was denied by the defendant. It was not disputed that the cellar was damp. Nor on the other hand was it disputed that soon after the plaintiffs moved into the house the District of Columbia raised the grade of the alley adjoining the house and that this caused an increased flow of water toward the basement of the house. Defendant also offered evidence which was not controverted that the accelerated flow of water from the new and higher grade of the alley could not find its way through the sewer drain in the areaway because the sewer drain had been permitted to become clogged with leaves and dirt. The trial judge made a general finding for defendant. Plaintiffs appeal and assign two errors: (1) That the ruling was contrary to and unsupported by the weight of the evidence and (2) that the finding was contrary to law. The first of these we cannot consider because it is no part of our function to inquire into weight of evidence. That is peculiarly the function of the trial court. Being necessarily coupled with the question whether the burden of proof has been carried it is not reviewable by us.\nConcerning the other ground of appeal there is almost as little doubt. Plaintiffs, having the burden of proof, were required to establish that there was actually a defect in the construction; that such defect was in fact the cause of the dampness in the cellar and that the damage resulting was chargeable to the defendant. The most that can be gleaned from the record is that on the essential elements of the case there was a sharp conflict in the evidence. The evidence indicated that plaintiffs’ damage may have been caused by a defect in construction, or by the new and seemingly unexpected raising of the grade of the alley by the District of Columbia, or by plaintiffs’ own failure to keep the sewer drain free of obstructions, or by some other cause. With a record of this kind before us we cannot say that the finding below was wrong. As was said by Justice Taft (then a judge of the Circuit Court) : “When a plaintiff produces evidence that is consistent with an hypothesis that the defendant is not negligent, and also with one that he is, his proof tends to establish neither.”\nAppellants rely principally on Kellogg Bridge Co. v. Hamilton, 110 U.S. 108, 3 S.Ct. 537, 28 L.Ed. 86, and Callaghan v. Stone, D. C. Municipal Court No. 403,858. We have examined those decisions and are satisfied that they are not applicable here. In the Kellogg, case there was an express finding of defective construction, and the Supreme Court upheld plaintiff’s contention that the doctrine of implied warranty applied. In Callaghan v. Stone there was a specific finding that a drain pipe had been laid in such a way that sewage drained toward rather than away from the house, in direct violation of the District plumbing regulations.\nAs before stated, plaintiffs made no such showing in this case. The effect of their own evidence was dubious at best and on every essential point there was substantial contradiction by defendant. For the reasons stated, we cannot say that the finding was wrong and it must therefore be\nAffirmed.\nCapital Apt. Corp. v. Vassos, 62 App.D.C. 136, 65 E.2d 482, and cases cited.\nEwing v.

COOPER.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'CAYTON, Associate Judge.\nDefendant rented premises 21 K Street, Southeast from one Thomas P. Brown in 1936. Plaintiff purchased the property from Brown in May, 1942, and received an assignment of the rental contract. The following month he called upon defendant to (1) vacate the premises or (2) pay an increased rental or (3) purchase the property. When defendant failed to do any of these things, plaintiff served him with a thirty-day notice to quit, and upon said notice predicated the possessory action from which this appeal arose. In the complaint it is recited that the tenancy has been terminated by reason of a breach of covenant not to sublet. In the rental contract from Brown to the defendant there was a provision against subletting and against carrying on any business in the premises other than that of a dwelling. It also provides: “that if, under the provisions of this agreement, default be made and a compromise or settlement shall be made thereupon it shall not constitute a waiver of any covenant herein contained.”\nDefendant does not personally occupy the house but has furnished it, and sublets to two families, each of whom pays him approximately $4.70 per week. He in turn pays the landlord $15 per month under the terms of his rental contract.\nIt is clear from the record that plaintiff accepted rent from the defendant with full knowledge that defendant was subletting the house to others. Indeed plaintiff had collected part of rentals due from sub-tenants and applied it toward rent due from defendant. The record does not reveal that plaintiff objected to the subletting at any time before commencing the ouster proceedings. Upon this showing the trial judge refused to evict the defendant and those who held under him and ordered judgment for defendant. On the authority of Merritt v. Kay, 54 App.D.C. 152, 295 F. 973, we hold that the trial judge ruled correctly. Here, as there, there was an acceptance of rent with full knowledge of the subletting. Moreover, it was clear that from the inception of the tenancy it was not for the personal occupancy of defendant, but for the express purpose of subletting. That was the established arrangement between defendant and original less- or. That was the state of the tenancy when plaintiff acquired the property and the assignment of the rental contract. He accepted the tenancy as he found it and approved defendant’s status. He cannot now be permitted to assert a claim which he has so clearly waived.\nAppellant contends that it was error to have admitted or considered the evidence relating to the attempt of plaintiff to raise the rent or force the defendant to buy the property. We think the evidence was clearly admissible, for it had a direct bearing on the question of waiver.\nPlaintiff questions the constitutionality of section 5(b) of the Emergency Rent Control Act. He claims that it violates the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. While our decision does not depend upon that or any other section of the Act, we direct attention to the fact that the constitutional question has been settled by the Supreme Court in Block v. Hirsh, 256 U.S. 135, 41 S.Ct. 458, 65 L.Ed. 865, 16 A.L.R. 165 (reversing the decision in 50 App.D.C. 56, 267 F. 614, 11 A.L.R. 1238) in construing the Ball Rent Act, which was enacted to meet an earlier war emergency in this District\nAffirmed. -\nAct of December 2, 1941, Public Law 327 — 77th Congress.

RIGGS NAT. BANK OF WASHINGTON, D. C.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'RICHARDSON, Chief Judge."". \'\nPlaintiff herein is the holder of a promissory note in the sum of $1000, one of a series secured by a deed of trust on certain real estate. Defendant Ober purchased the property on which the note was secured without assuming or becoming personally liable thereon. However, when the note matured he secured an extension of the time of payment, and thereafter successive extensions to November 16,. 1937, on each occasion signing an agreement wherein he assumed and agreed-to pay the note. These agreements were on the same printed form, the last dated January 23, 1937, being as follows:\n“The time of payment of the annexed note: No. 18 of 22 for $1000.00, dated November 16, 1925, due November 16, 1936, 6%, signed by Carlton E. Moran and Frederick A. Blumer, secured by deed of trust on lot 30, square 1933, 3614 Fulton Street, N. W., is hereby extended to November 16, 1937, with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum, until paid, payable semi-annually, and in consideration of the consent by the present holder of said note to this extension I hereby assume and agree to pay said note and interest thereon at the rate aforesaid without,demand, notice or protest, or notice of the acceptance of this guarantee. Said note and the deed of trust securing same to remain otherwise unqualified and in full force and effect.\n“SEE PREPAYMENT PRIVILEGE ON REVERSE SIDE\n“George C. Ober, Jr.,\n“Owners of Property.\n“For and in consideration of the assumption and guarantee of payment of the note as above provided, the said extension is hereby agree to.\n“ v.\n""Holder of Note.”\nOn the reverse side is a memorandum, signed by plaintiff and defendant, that on thirty days’ notice the note may be paid at any time.\nIn January, 1937, defendant sold the property to one Peterson. The transfer was made without an assumption of the trust indebtedness by the purchaser.\nOn November 16, 1937, plaintiff entered into an extension agreement with Peterson, identical in form with those signed by defendant, but which reduced the interest rate during the extension period from 6% to 5yz% and extended the payment of $500 for one year and the remaining $500 for two years. Defendant was not advised and had no knowledge of the making of this extension agreement.\nSubsequently Peterson defaulted, the property was sold and a deficiency resulted. The bank sued defendant Ober for the amount of this deficiency.\nThe defense was that the extension to Peterson, without defendant’s knowledge or consent, discharged defendant from liability on his undertaking. The trial court overruled this, and gave judgment for plaintiff. From that judgment defendant appeals.\nThe defense is based on the theory (1) that the liability incurred by signing the extension agreement was secondary and not primary, or (2) that it became secondary when Peterson subsequently made himself responsible to the holder of the note. If either hypothesis were correct, the extension of the time of payment would have discharged defendant’s liability.\nTreating himself as a party liable on the note, certain sections of the Negotiable Instruments Act, Title 28, Sec. 504 and 802 D.C.Code, 1940 Edition, are cited by defendant. Sections 119 and 302 would be equally pertinent.\nIn our opinion, however, defendant was not at any time a party to or liable on the note. His agreement was wholly collateral to and legally independent of the note, and the code sections cited have no application.\nIt is true that in Ragan v. Wardell, 67 App.D.C. 222, 91 F.2d 253, 254, the court in the preliminary statement of facts in its opinion, speaking of a similar extension agreement, said, “the slip being attached to the six original notes and made á part thereof”, and then describing a later extension said that the slips “were severally attached to the original notes and became a part of them.” But these expressions were merely recitals from the statement of evidence in the transcript; the case did not involve the status or liabilities of any of the parties to the note or extension agreement, and the statements quoted cannot be regarded as rulings by the court on a matter of law.\nIn Bergmann v. Puhl, 195 Wis. 120, 217 N.W. 746, 747, 56 A.L.R. 915, after a note had been delivered, a guaranty of the vendors was annexed. The suit was brought on the note against the makers and the guarantors. The latter demurred on the ground of misjoinder of actions. On appeal the demurrer was sustained. The court said: “The plaintiff wholly misconceived the effect of attaching a separate document executed subsequently to the making and delivery of a promissory note, to the note itself.”\nAfter quoting the section (Sec. 504 supra) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the opinion continues: “The only exception to the rule that an indorser becomes such only by placing his signature upon the instrument is that where the back of the instrument has been covered by indorse-ments or other writing, leaving no room for further indorsements, a strip of paper called an ‘allonge’ may be attached to the instrument, and subsequent indorsements may be written thereon. When these conditions are complied with, the writing upon the allonge has the same effect as if it were made upon the instrument itself.”\nAccordingly we must look to defendant’s agreement with the plaintiff to determine his liability.\nThe relationship of the several parties who successively owned the property in question to the holder of the note secured thereon, and to each other is, we think, governed by various local cases including Shepherd v. May, 115 U.S. 505, 6 S.Ct. 119, 121, 29 L.Ed. 456, arising from this District. Shepherd, the original own.er of certain property, executed a deed of trust and note to May. Thereafter Shepherd sold the property to Walker, who did not assume the incumbrance. When the note matured, Walker, without the knowledge or consent of Shepherd, secured from May an extension of the note. In the suit by May against Shepherd the latter claimed that at the time of the extension Walker undertook to pay the note.\nThe court held that the contention of Shepherd that Walker became the principal debtor and that his own liability continued only as surety was not well founded. The court said: “And if Walker had expressly promised May to pay the debt, that would not, without the assent of May, have converted Shepherd from a principal debtor into a surety merely. Cucullu v. Hernandez, 103 U.S. 105 [26 L.Ed. 322] ; Rey v. Simpson, 22 How. 341 [16 L.Ed. 260], The only way in which Walker could become the principal debtor of May, and Shepherd the surety, was by the mutual agreement of all three. There is no proof of any such agreement. It follows that as the relation of principal and surety did not exist between Walker and Shepherd, the latter was not discharged from his liability to May by the contract of May with Walker to extend the time for the payment of the money due on Shepherd’s note.”\nIn Cucullu v. Hernandez, 103 U.S. 105, 116, 26 L.Ed. 322, 41 A.L.R. 285, the purchaser had assumed payment of the mortgage, differing to that extent from the facts of the present case. The court, however, said in the course of its opinion: “It cannot, we think, he reasonably claimed that a debtor is converted into a surety by his creditor’s acceptance of an additional promise from a third person to pay the debt due him by his debtor. There is no element of suretyship in such a contract, unless it be that the additional debtor might be regarded as surety for the original debt- or. The relation between the creditor and the original debtor is not changed by such an arrangement.”\nKaufman v. Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., 62 App.D.C. 37, 64 F.2d 160, involved an action against the guarantor of certain notes who had indorsed on each a guaranty of payment. The notes were secured by a deed of trust on real estate which the maker of the notes thereafter sold and conveyed without an assumption of the debt by the purchaser. The latter thereafter entered into an extension agreement with the holder of the notes, and it was claimed that this discharged the liability of the guarantor. The court held that an extension granted by the holder of a note by contract with the third person, not a party to the note, does not have the effect of releasing the guarantor even if made without his knowledge or consent. It drew a distinction between the effect of an extension of time granted by the holder to the guarantor and one given to the person for whom the guaranty was given, which latter would of course release the guarantor.\nAnother phase of the same subject was considered in De Leon v. Rhines, 64 App.D.C. 73, 74 F.2d 477, 479. Rhines had executed a note and deed of trust to Dumas. Thereafter he sold the real estate to Brown who took title subject to the trust without assuming its payment. Brown sold to Cameron who by the conveyance assumed and agreed to pay the note. The holder of the note granted an extension to Cameron and in the suit against Rhines this extension was pleaded as a discharge. The court cited the foregoing cases on this subject and said: “According to the principles thus enunciated, as applied to the present case, the, only way whereby Cameron could have become the principal debtor in the obligation \'of Rhines was by the mutual agreement of Dumas, Cameron, and Mr. and Mrs. Rhines.”\nThe subj ect was also considered in Wolfe v. Murphy, 47 App.D.C. 296, where the extension agreement was made between the holder of the note and the immediate purchaser from the maker. In the conveyance from the maker the purchaser had assumed the payment of the note. It was held that the extension did not discharge the liability of the maker.\nDefendant contends that if his liability was not secondary prior to the agreement between the bank and Peterson, whereby the latter assumed payment of the note, it became such when this assumption of liability on Peterson’s part occurred. But as Peterson’s assumption of liability was a part of the extension agreement, which appellant claims relieved him of all liability, the result would be that at no time could it be said that his liability was secondary.\nApplying these decisions to the facts of the present case we find that there was no privity of contract, relation of principal and surety, or subordination of liability as between the original makers of the note in suit, the defendant Ober, or his vendee Peterson. From each, at different times, the holder of the note obtained an absolute and unconditional promise to pay the debt represented by the note. The original makers obligated themselves by the terms of the note; the subsequent successive owners of the property by their assumption of and agreement to pay the note. What rights of action might accrue in favor of one who might pay the note as against the others is no concern of the plaintiff.\nThe defendant strongly urges that the holder of the note estopped himself to assert the liability of the defendant by entering into the extension agreement with his vendee Peterson. It is urged that plaintiff thereby made impossible a foreclosure of the deed of trust when it matured according to its agreement with defendant, and that defendant, had he paid the note according to his own promise, could not have protected himself by foreclosure of the lien.\nThe same contention was made by the maker of the note when sued in the case of Wolfe v. Murphy, supra, and was the basis of the dissenting opinion in that case by Mr. Justice Robb. It was overruled in the majority decision, and persons subsequently granting extensions to owners of property purchased from the original lienor have been entitled to rely upon the rule so established. In any event we are bound by the decision of the majority in that case.\nThe suggestion that a continuing liability over many years would result if a person situated as is the defendant were not released by extensions of the note is answered by the statute of limitations.\nAffirmed.\nSec. 504: “A person placing his signature upon an instrument otherwise than as a maker, drawer, or acceptor is deemed to be an indorser, unless he clear- . ly indicates by appropriate words his intention to be bound in some other capacity.”\nSec. 802: “A person secondarily liable on the instrument is discharged— * * * Sixth. By an agreement binding upon the holder to extend the time of payment, or to postpone the holder’s right to enforce the instrument, unless made with the assent of the party secondarily liable or unless the right of recourse against such party is expressly reserved.”\nSec. 119: “No person is liable on the instrument whose signature does not appear thereon, except as herein otherwise expressly provided.”\nSec. S02: “The indorsement must be written on the instrument itself or upon a paper attached thereto.”\n“In the Annotation (56 A.L.R. 921) it is said: “It may be\'very generally stated that by the great weight of authority a writing not on the instrument itself is ineffective to charge one with the \' ■ liability of an indorser, or to give rights of an indorsee. The one exception\' to this rule i& in the case of an ‘allonge’ .\nIn the numerous cases involving lia- . . bility of persons executing note extension agreements we have found no instance where such a person was regarded\' as liable “on the note” as distinguished from liability “for the note”.\nBergmann v.

BUTLER et al.'], 'opinions': [{'text': ""CAYTON, Associate Judge.\nPlaintiffs had for several years been the owners of premises 1409 Emerson Street, N. W. in this District. For some seven years prior to July 1941 they had personally occupied the premises as a dwelling. They then leased it to the defendant Myrtle B. Gould for a term of one year. When the lease was made Mr. Butler (to whom we shall refer as plaintiff) told Mrs. Gould that he would want to resume possession at the end of the lease which by its terms expired on July 31, 1942. Plaintiffs in the meantime went to live on a farm which Mr. Butler owned jointly with a brother. His arrangement with that brother was that they would alternately occupy the farm for two year periods. His period of occupancy was to expire at the end of 1942. Plaintiff is employed in a dairy in Alexandria, Virginia. His immediate family consists of himself, his wife and a young daughter. Both his daughter and wife are suffering from ill health; the farm house is an old structure and not well heated; because of the existing labor shortage he cannot obtain help to cut wood for heating purposes. He wrote to defendant early in June 1942 stating that he wished to repossess his property when the lease expired on August 1. The house involved in the suit consists of nine rooms and three baths and at the time of trial was occupied by defendant and her two children, and also by eight roomers who rent' from defendant, and most of whom are serving the federal government.\nDefendant failed to vacate and there followed a thirty-day notice to quit and, on October 1, 1942, a possessory action in the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Municipal Court. Trial was without a jury. The trial judge filed a written memorandum making a careful review of the situation and ordering, as of October 22, a finding for plaintiffs and granting a stay of execution to December 15, 1942. Defendant appeals and assigns five reasons for reversal :\n1. Defendant contends that the Rent Control Law “should be applied, not in view of the controversy of the parties, but rather in the light of the evils the act was designed to remedy”. Naturally we cannot undertake to decide abstract propositions, but must direct our attention to the case as tried and decided. We do not forget that the Rent Control Law was enacted to prevent the injustices which would be expected to flow from the acutely overcrowded conditions of a war-time Capital; or that it is legislation of a broad social nature and should be reasonably construed so as to accomplish its purposes. One of those purposes is to “freeze” existing tenancies and prevent the ouster of tenants in possession of dwelling, properties. Congress, however, made an exception (among certain others) in a situation where — “The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the property for his immediate and personal use and occupancy as a dwelling”.\nWe agree that in testing plaintiffs’ right to possession under this clause, the spirit as well as the letter of the Act should be considered, and that pretext and flimsy showings should not form the basis for ousting tenants and adding to the acute housing problem in the District. But that is not the situation here. These plaintiffs have no other place to go. They have lost (for two years at least) the right to occupy their farm property. It is but natural that they should turn to their own home here. Congress made an exception in cases of this kind, and we think the trial judge was correct in recognizing the case as properly within the excepted class. Shaffer v. Bowes, D.C.Mun.App., 31 A.2d 690; Colwell v. Stonebraker, D.C.Mun.App., 31 A. 2d 866.\n2. Defendant next urges that the good faith of a landlord seeking possession is not to be measured by his state of mind but by the circumstances of the case. We agree that in examining the question of good faith all circumstances should be considered which will shed light upon whether a proper case for possession has been es- . tablished. Among these circumstances, is, we think, the state of mind, intent and purpose of the suing landlord as reflected in the evidence. For all of these elements are bound up with the question of good faith, and may help the court decide whether the landlord is merely attempting to juggle his property for profit, or legitimately requires it to live in.\n3. Defendant insists that there was no sufficient showing that plaintiffs required the property for their immediate and personal use as a dwelling, and points to the fact that though plaintiffs might have remained on their farm until January 1, 1943, they commenced the landlord-tenant suit on October 1, 1942. Perhaps an immediate answer is to be found in the generous stay (to December 15th) which the trial court allowed. Furthermore we ■ think it cannot be said that one who leased his property for precisely one year, made it plain at the time that when the year expired he wished it back, reiterated it almost two months before the expiration of the lease, and finally sued for possession two months after he might have sued, can be said to have been derelict, unfair or unduly hasty in his dealings with the tenant. We think the situation is somewhat analogous to that of a landlord who being required to give only thirty days notice to quit actually gives a longer notice. Our court of last resort ruled in Bliss v. Duncan, 44 App.D.C. 93, that a tenant cannot complain because he receives - a longer notice . than the law- requires. We think it would be imposing an unfair restriction to require a showing in cases like this that the landlord must have his property at once. The word immediate as used in the Rent Act,, need not always mean desperate.\n4. Because the plaintiff works in Alexandria, Virginia defendant contends that he is not within the protective purview of the Rent Act as one would be whose duties ■ required him to work within the District. We cannot accept this view. For many practical purposes the city of Alexandria is like a suburb of Washington and we judicially know that many people who work here live in Alexandria. Probably the converse is also true. Should the plaintiff be denied the protection of the law merely because the necessity of earning a living takes him into the suburban area? Can we say that because his work is in Alexandria he must look for living quar7 ters there when in fact he owns a home here in Washington? We think not.\n5. Finally defendant urges that plaintiffs should not have possession because it would result in ousting eight roomers who have' rented from defendant and live in the premises, and who are not parties to this suit. He bases this contention upon Section 5(b) of the Rent Control Act which prohibits an action against any “tenant” who continues to pay rent. . Section 11(f) of the Act defines a “tenant” as a sub-tenant, sub-lessee or other person entitled to the use of housing accommodations.\nIt is plain that the conventional relation of landlord and tenant does not exist between plaintiffs and defendant’s roomers. Plaintiffs would have found it difficult if not impossible to frame an action so as to properly include them as defendants. As to the substantive rights of the parties it should be noted that between plaintiffs and such sub-tenants there was no privity of estate or contract. When defendant’s lease expired, their tenancy came to an end with it. . Looking to the procedural aspect, we find in the established Code enactments no provision for making sub-tenants parties defendant in a possessory action. Nor is there such a provision anywhere in the Rent Control Act or in any order, rule or regulation of the Rent Control Administrator. Nor has the Municipal Court made any rule which requires that sub-tenants, roomers or lodgers be joined as parties defendant in landlord and tenant actions. We express no opinion concerning the advisability of such a procedural requirement; we simply point out that none now exists.\nIt may be that when plaintiffs’ judgment is put into effect they may arrange to accept some or all of the tenants in possession as their own tenants. Certain it is that there need be no fear of profiteering, for the rentals cannot be increased except by order of the Rent Administrator.\nFor such of the tenants as the plaintiffs cannot accommodate there will undoubtedly be a hardship. But neither Congress nor the courts can offer assurance that in the administration of the Act and in the adjudication of cases arising thereunder there will never be a single case of hardship. The most that can be done is to approach such problems sympathetically and examine each claim for possession critically and render judgment according to the right of the matter and the law. This the trial court has done. Its judgment should be Affirmed.\nCode 1940, 45 — 1601 et seq.\nLesser v. Pomin, 3 Cal.App.2d 117, 39 P.2d 451; City Inv. Co. v.
